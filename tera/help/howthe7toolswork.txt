bkoats2016 in test

margaret 
I renamed folder bkoats2016_prev

load created 2 files: run.sql and load.ctl 

data
creates the .dat file

copy copies the .dat file to the cdstage bulkload area on the burdock server/

add: probably runs the sql created in eraload 
join: joins the sheet to the main dataset table. 

I have no clue where the .dat file is used!
