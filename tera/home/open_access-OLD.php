<h2>Broadbalk Wheat:</h2>
<p><a href="index.php?area=home&page=index&dataset=4&sub=bbk_open_access#SEC1">Broadbalk Yields</a><br>
  <br>
Mean long-term winter wheat yields from selected treatments   on Broadbalk. The changes reflect the improved cultivars, cultivations and   control of pests, diseases and weeds that have been introduced on Broadbalk,   especially since the 1960s.Yields of continuous   wheat given no fertilizer or manure have remained at around 1 t ha-1.   Since 1979 summer fungicides have been used, which has allowed us to exploit the   greater grain yield potential of modern cultivars. In 1968 a rotation was   introduced on part of the experiment, so that it is now possible to compare the   yields of wheat grown continuously and as the first wheat after a two year   break. The highest yields are now from the first wheat crop in rotation, with   the best yields from fertilizer alone exceeding those from FYM alone, and the   combination of FYM + 96 kgN ha-1 (144 kgN ha-1 since 2005)   often exceeding both.</p>

<p><a href="index.php?area=home&page=index&dataset=4&sub=bbk_open_access#SEC2">Broadbalk Soil Carbon</a></p>
<p>Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content in selected   treatments of the Broadbalk experiment, where winter wheat has been grown each year since 1843. SOC (0-23cm) has remained almost constant in the unfertilized plot, at the equilibrium level for this farming system on this soil type. Inorganic fertilizer (NPK) has enhanced SOC a little, probably due to increased returns of organic matter in crop roots and residues. The treatment given 35 t ha-1 FYM now contains almost three times as much SOC as the unfertilized plot. Increases were greatest in the initial years of the experiment. </p>

<p><a href="index.php?area=home&page=index&dataset=4&sub=bbk_open_access#SEC3">Broadbalk Soil:  Concentration of Olsen P (plant-available P)</a></p>

<p>Changes in plant-available P (Olsen P) in the topsoil (0-23cm) of selected plots of the Broadbalk wheat experiment since 1843. The accumulation of available P was greatest on the FYM plot, reflecting the larger total P inputs in FYM compared to that applied as inorganic fertilizer or where no P was applied. The larger Olsen P concentrations on plot 5 (PKMg) compared to plot 8 (N3PKMg), despite their similar P inputs, were a result of the higher yields and greater P offtakes in the crop on plot 8, due to the applied N. The relatively low Olsen P concentrations on plot 18 (N2 1/2PKMg) were a result of the limited P inputs between 1844 and 2001. Olsen P concentrations were least on plots receiving no (or very little) P inputs in fertilizer (plot 3, given no fertilizer or manure).

<h2>Broadbalk & Geescroft Wilderness Experiments:</h2>
<p><a href="index.php?area=home&page=index&dataset=8&sub=wilderness_open_access">Accumulation of organic carbon in soil and trees</a></p>
<p>The accumulation of organic carbon in soil and tree biomass has been measured on two contrasting sites at Rothamsted that were fenced off in the 1880s and allowed to revert naturally to woodland. Both sites had grown arable crops for many years before. 
The <b>Broadbalk</b> site grew unmanured winter wheat since 1843. Large amounts of chalk had been applied, and the surface soil pH is still neutral (pH 7.7). Since 1882 it has been allowed to naturally revert to woodland. The larger <b>Geescroft</b> site grew beans (<i>Vicia faba</i>) for many years, and has been left uncultivated since 1883. It did not recieve as much chalk as the Broadbalk site, and the soil is now acidic (pH 4.4 in 1999). Although not experiments in the usual sense, these two areas of regenerating woodland are of great value, providing information on the long-term sequestration of carbon in soil and vegetation.  </p>

<h2>Park Grass:</h2>
<p><a href="index.php?area=home&page=index&dataset=1&sub=pg_open_access">Park Grass Species Diversity</a></p>
<p>The impact of selected treatments on the number of species   comprising 1% or more of the biomass. Numbers of species have decreased, even on   the nil plots. This may be due to changes in atmospheric inputs and/or changes   in sward management. Applying N as sodium nitrate (N*) or ammonium sulphate (N)   reduces diversity further, and in the ammonium form also rapidly acidifies the   soil, reducing the number of species to one or two.   Applying chalk aids recovery from acidity. Withholding N causes more species to return (not shown).</p>
<p><a href="Park/pg_open_access#SEC2">Park Grass pH</a></p>
<p>The  changes in pH of the soil (at depth 0-23cm) on Park Grass in response to atmospheric deposition and fertilizer inputs, and then consequent management by liming. The pH was  approximately 5.5  when the experiment began.  A regular test of liming  began in 1903 with chalk applied every 4 years to the southern half of most  plots. Plots were then further sub-divided to give a further range of pHs. Soil pH  is c 3.5 on the plots given most ammonium  sulphate and 5.0-5.3 on the un-limed, unfertilized plots. Sub plot c of most  plots is nearest to the original soil pH. Soil pH has slowly recovered by about  0.5 pH units on some plots more than 25 years after ammonium sulphate was last  applied.</p>

<h2>Hoos Barley:</h2>
<p><a href="index.php?area=home&page=index&dataset=5&sub=hoos_open_access#SEC1">Hoosfield Soil Carbon</a></p>
<p>Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content in selected   treatments of the Hoosfield experiment, where spring barley has been grown each   year since 1852. SOC (0-23cm) has remained almost constant in the unfertilized plot since   the 1880s, at the equilibrium level for this farming system on this soil type.   Annual applications of 35 t ha-1 FYM increased SOC rapidly at first, then more   slowly. This treatment now contains around three times as much SOC as the   unfertilized plot. The third treatment, given FYM for just 20 years between 1852   and 1871, still contains more SOC than the unfertilized plot.</p>
<p><a href="index.php?area=home&page=index&dataset=5&sub=hoos_open_access#SEC2">Hoosfield Yields</a></p>
<P>Mean long-term spring barley yields from selected treatments on the Hoosfield experiment are shown. Spring barley has been grown continuously since 1852. The changes in yield reflect the improved varieties, cultivations and control of weeds and diseases that have been introduced, especially since the late 1960s. </p>
