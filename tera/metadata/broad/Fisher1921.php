<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This dataset consists of annual wheat yields from selected plots of the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, 1852-1918, as used by R.A. Fisher in his 1921 paper 'Studies in crop variation'. It is the
annual data used to derive the mean values published in Table 1 of this paper. </p>
<p><h1>Data</h1></p>
<p>Data are presented as annual dressed wheat grain yields, in bushels/acre, from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, Herts, AL5 2JQ, UK. 
Data is given for 13 plots (2b, 3&4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17 and 18), from 1852-1918 inclusive.

<h1>Provenance &amp; Quality</h1>
<p>Data from plots 2b, 3&4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17 and 18 were transcribed
from Fisher's original hand written datasheets. These are kept in the Rothamsted Research Library Archive. The original datasheets for plots 6-8 could not be found in the Archive, so the annual data have been 
re-constructed, based on yield data in the e-RA Database, dataset BKYIELD. See Supporting Information for more details of how this was done. Verification includes checking all data entry, checking that the
mean values agree with Fisher's mean values in Table 1 of the 1921 paper and re-constructing known data from plots 5 and 11 to check which sub-plots were used by Fisher. There are some minor differences, see 
Supporting Information for more details. The raw data used to derive the yields for plots 6-8 is
available, after registering, from the e-RA database. Please contact the <a href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk">e-RA Curators</a> for an access password and further details.</p>

<p>Yields in the original Fisher paper were expressed as bushels/acre. A bushel is a measure of volume, eight gallons or 36.369 litres.
Grain yields in e-RA have since been converted to t/ha, using bushel weights, ie the weight of one bushel of wheat grain. Bushel weights were determined after harvest by weighing a bushel measure filled with grain.
