<h2>Publication Lists</h2>
<p>BioWeb is used largely to populate Intranet and intranet web pages. One aspect of its use is providing a list of publications: by
authors, year, groups, projects. At the moment, we are collecting publications lists in an endnote file which has three additional
fields used by BioWeb: Custom1 is GroupID, Custom2 is Project ID, Custom 3 is RUP: Reviewed, Unreviewed, Poster/Presentation.
If you want to see your own articled listed on your web page (on BAB internet site, you can help us by providing us with (listed in 
order of preference): 
<ul>
<li>An Endnote Library file, of your own papers, with custom1, custom2, and custom3 appropriatly filled (see link bellow for help on 
that)</li>
<li>A Word file containing your papers: Please follow each paper title with group number, and Project number if relevant</li>
<li>A PDF file (same as above) </li>
<li>To avoid if possible, but better than nothing : a piece of paper with a scribble on it....</li>
</ul>
