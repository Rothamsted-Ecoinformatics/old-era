  <p> Rothamsted Research has the oldest continuous field experiments in the world, dating back more than 170 years. We hope to share the data within e-RA, that provides a unique scientific resource, with the scientific community worldwide. In sharing this resource we can work together with other associated institutes and organisations, some of which are listed here.</p>
