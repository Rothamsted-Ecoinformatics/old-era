TI Variable responses of the soil microbial biomass to trace concentrations of 13C-labelled glucose, using 13C-PLFA analysis

AB 13C-labelled glucose was applied to arable (Broadbalk NPK) and permanent grassland (Woburn Grassland) soils to investigate the response of the soil microbial biomass (SMB) to carbon (C) applied at trace concentrations. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were used as biomarkers for G+ve (odd-chained and iso/anteiso FA) and G-ve bacteria (mono-unsaturated and cyclic FA), actinobacteria (10-methyl-branched FA), fungi (octadecadienoic acid) and general membrane lipids [16:0,18:0]. Gas chromatography-combustion-stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) was used to determine the incorporation of 13C into individual PLFA in two experiments: first, after application of a single concentration (15 mu g C g-1) of 13C-glucose over a time sequence (0, 8, 24, 48, 120 and 240 hours), and second after application at three concentrations (25, 83, 416 mu g C g-1 soil after 120 hours). 13C incorporation into PLFA over time was similar in both soils. However, in the permanent grassland soil, 13C incorporation was increased in actinobacteria PLFA at 120 hours when [16:0,18:0] was reduced. At 240 hours, 13C incorporation increased in [16:0,18:0] concurrently with a reduction in G+ve bacteria PLFA. Increasing glucose concentration caused different responses in the SMB of both soils. In the arable soil, all biomarker PLFA concentrations increased at all rates of application. In contrast, in the permanent grassland soil PLFA concentrations were similar to the control in all SMB groups, except G+ve bacteria after the greatest rate of application. However, the delta 13C values of the same PLFA indicated that uptake of applied 13C-glucose was proportional to the applied concentration in all groups of soil bacteria in both soils.

AB man-made changes to the composition of the air over a 200 year period on the severity of arable crop disease epidemics. The review focuses on two well-studied UK arable crops, wheat and oilseed rape, relating these examples to worldwide food security. In wheat, impacts of changes in concentrations of SO2 in air on two septoria diseases are discussed using data obtained from historical crop samples and unpublished experimental work. Changes in SO2 seem to alter septoria disease spectra both through direct effects on infection processes and through indirect effects on soil S status. Work on the oilseed rape diseases phoma stem canker and light leaf spot illustrates indirect impacts of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, mediated through climate change. It is projected that, by the 2050s, if diseases are not controlled, climate change will increase yields in Scotland but halve yields in southern England. These projections are discussed in relation to strategies for adaptation to environmental change. Since many strategies take 10-15 years to implement, it is important to take appropriate decisions soon. Furthermore, it is essential to make appropriate investment in collation of long-term data, modelling and experimental work to guide such decision-making by industry and government, as a contribution to worldwide food security.

TI Impact of land management practices on high-affinity methanotrophic bacterial populations: evidence from long-term sites at Rothamsted

DI 10.1111/j.1365-2389.2010.01339.x
AB The impacts of land-use change and long-term agricultural practices on the bacterial and methanotrophic biomass in the soils comprising the Classical Experiments at Rothamsted Research were investigated by using 13CH(4) phospholipid fatty acid stable isotope probing (PLFA SIP). Nine sites were studied, including six arable plots, two regenerated woodlands and a regenerated grassland. The regenerating sites had all been in arable cropping for at least 200 years (and probably much longer) before commencing regeneration approximately 120 years ago. Six sites were plots within the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, which had been cultivated, and on which winter wheat was grown annually for 163 years with different fertilizer and manure treatments; the field had been in arable cropping for at least 200 years previously. Triplicate soil samples were incubated under 2 ppmv 13CH(4) for up to 100 days. Extraction and 13C-PLFA analysis revealed that overall methanotrophic biomass was smaller in the Rothamsted soils compared with the other mineral soils studied to date, as indicated by poor 13C incorporation. High-affinity methanotrophs similar to known type II methanotrophs were most abundant in all of the soils studied, except in two plots receiving farmyard manure (FYM and FYM + N). Manuring resulted in a shift to a population similar to known type I methanotrophs. Methanotrophic biomass was elevated in soils that had received the largest input of N fertilizer, though without detectable differences in CH4 oxidation rates, indicating the potential mediation of atmospheric CH4 oxidation by non-methanotrophs, which are most likely to be nitrifying bacteria.

TI Soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change: a critical re-examination to identify the true and the false
SO European Journal of Soil Science
VL 62
IS 1
PG 42-55
DI 10.1111/j.1365-2389.2010.01342.x
AB The term 'carbon sequestration' is commonly used to describe any increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) content caused by a change in land management, with the implication that increased soil carbon (C) storage mitigates climate change. However, this is only true if the management practice causes an additional net transfer of C from the atmosphere to land. Limitations of C sequestration for climate change mitigation include the following constraints: (i) the quantity of C stored in soil is finite, (ii) the process is reversible and (iii) even if SOC is increased there may be changes in the fluxes of other greenhouse gases, especially nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane. Removing land from annual cropping and converting to forest, grassland or perennial crops will remove C from atmospheric CO2 and genuinely contribute to climate change mitigation. However, indirect effects such as conversion of land elsewhere under native vegetation to agriculture could negate the benefit through increased CO2 emission. Re-vegetating degraded land, of limited value for food production, avoids this problem. Adding organic materials such as crop residues or animal manure to soil, whilst increasing SOC, generally does not constitute an additional transfer of C from the atmosphere to land, depending on the alternative fate of the residue. Increases in SOC from reduced tillage now appear to be much smaller than previously claimed, at least in temperate regions, and in some situations increased N2O emission may negate any increase in stored C. The climate change benefit of increased SOC from enhanced crop growth (for example from the use of fertilizers) must be balanced against greenhouse gas emissions associated with manufacture and use of fertilizer. An over-emphasis on the benefits of soil C sequestration may detract from other measures that are at least as effective in combating climate change, including slowing deforestation and increasing efficiency of N use in order to decrease N2O emissions.

AB Increasing applications of nitrogen fertilizer to wheat (from 0 to 288 kg/ha) resulted in an increased proportion of gliadin proteins and increased dough extensibility. Flour from a plot receiving 192 kg/ha N (and no S) was similar to that from a plot receiving 192 kg/ha N and 53 kg/ha S, but the proportion of omega-gliadins was increased and dough strength was more similar to that from plots with lower N. The grain %N from a plot receiving 35 t/ha farmyard manure was similar to that from the plot receiving 144 kg/ha N, indicating that much of the applied N was unavailable. The protein composition and dough properties of flour from this plot were similar to those of grain from conventionally fertilized plots with similar grain N contents. Similar differences in grain N content, protein composition, and functional properties were observed in grain samples from commercial organic and conventional farms.

AB retention, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and porosity of two English soils: North Wyke (NW) grassland clay topsoil and Broadbalk silty topsoil, fertilized inorganically (PKMg) or with farmyard manure (FYM). As expected, the FYM topsoil had greater porosity and greater water retention than PKMg topsoil, and the NW clay topsoil retained more water at each matric potential than the silty topsoils. Compaction had a clear effect on water retention at matric potentials wetter than -10 kPa for the PKMg and FYM soils, corresponding to voids greater than 30 m cylindrical diameter, whereas smaller voids appeared to be unaffected. The Pore-Cor void network model has been improved by including a Euler &beta; distribution to describe the sizes of the narrow interconnections, termed throats. The model revealed a change from bimodal to unimodal throat size distributions on compaction, as well as a reduction in sizes overall. It also matched the water retention curves more closely than van Genuchten fits and correctly predicted changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity better than those predicted by a prior statistical approach. However, the changes in hydraulic conductivity were masked by the stochastic variability of the model. Also, an artifact of the model, namely its inability to pack small features close together, caused incorrect increases in pore sizes on compaction. These deficiencies in the model demonstrate the need for an explicitly dual porous network model to account for the effects of compaction in soil.

DI 10.1007/978-90-481-8859-8_5
AB Some scientific work can be so far ahead of its time that it is not taken up by contemporaries and is largely forgotten. High-resolution digital soil sensing and mapping is a classic example of this. The earliest work in this area can be found in three papers in 1925 and another in 1928 by the Rothamsted soil physicists Haines and Keen. This was not really followed up until the 1990s when precision agriculture became the focus. The major developments in these papers are disinterred. Haines and Keen were concerned with how tillage forces varied, in order to design efficient and effective tillage operations. The first paper described instrumentation - a dynamometer - capable of sensing soil strength (actually drawbar pull) and its real-time recording, which they designed and built. The second looked at soil uniformity 'by means of dynamometer and plough'. They produced perhaps the first contour maps of a soil property at high (or any) resolution. The third paper dealt with the Rothamsted classical experiments which are now in their 167th year. The results of the Broadbalk experiment are shown as a perspective plot (familiar to all users of surface plotting programs) but constructed by quite different means. They found, perhaps to their surprise, that the signal of intrinsic soil differences in strength was heavily imprinted over the treatment effects even after 80 years of continuous wheat. In the fourth paper they recognised the need for a more light-weight, portable, and robust sensing system which they designed, built, and demonstrated, as well as a data-filtering technique based on the viscosity of oil in a sensor-recording system.

PG 327-336
DI 10.1104/pp.110.153759
AB Interactions between sulfur (S) nutritional status and sulfate transporter expression in field-grown wheat (Triticum aestivum) were investigated using Broadbalk +S and -S treatments (S fertilizer withheld) at Rothamsted, United Kingdom. In 2008, S, sulfate, selenium (Se), and molybdenum (Mo) concentrations and sulfate transporter gene expression were analyzed throughout development. Total S concentrations were lower in all tissues of -S plants, principally as a result of decreased sulfate pools. S, Se, and Mo concentrations increased in vegetative tissues until anthesis, and thereafter, with the exception of Mo, decreased until maturity. At maturity, most of the S and Se were localized in the grain, indicating efficient remobilization from vegetative tissues, whereas less Mo was remobilized. At maturity, Se and Mo were enhanced 7- and 3.7-fold, respectively, in -S compared with +S grain, while grain total S was not significantly reduced. Enhanced expression of sulfate transporters, for example Sultr1;1 and Sultr4;1, in -S plants explains the much increased accumulation of Se and Mo (7- and 3.7-fold compared with +S in grain, respectively). Sultr5;2 (mot1), thought to be involved in Mo accumulation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), did not fully explain patterns of Mo distribution;it was expressed in all tissues, decreasing in leaf and increasing in roots under -S conditions, and was expressed in florets at anthesis but not in grain at any other time. In conclusion, S fertilizer application has a marked impact on Mo and Se distribution and accumulation, which is at least partially a result of altered gene expression of the sulfate transporter family.

AB The intensification of crop management in the U.K. over the past 60 years has resulted in the decline of the Populations of a number of annual plant species adapted to arable habitats. In contrast, other species continue to be common as arable weeds. A Community assembly approach was taken to explain these recent changes in the weed flora using databases of plant functional traits, a pot experiment, and weed surveys OF the Broadbalk long-term experiment. The hypothesis was tested that species that have been selected against by increased fertilizer inputs and herbicide use share an adverse combination of traits. An analysis comparing the combination Of Maximum height, seed weight, and time of first flowering of 29 common and 32 rare or threatened U.K. autumn weeds established that rare or threatened species Occupied an area of trait space that was distinct from the common species. A rare weed trait syndrome of short stature, large seed, and late flowering was identified. The theory that species with a trait syndrome that is Currently unfavorable are better adapted for less fertile environments was Supported by the pot experiment. Species with a combination of short stature and large seed had a relatively greater competitive ability in low compared to high fertility treatments. Analysis of survey data from the Broadbalk long-term experiment confirmed that, as N inputs increased, the abundance of the two functional groups that contained only common species remained stable or increased; whereas, the groups dominated by rare or threatened species declined as fertility increased. An understanding of the response traits of arable plants to management filters, including fertilizer inputs and herbicide, is valuable for designing conservation strategies for rare species or predicting Future shifts in the functional diversity of weed communities including the potential for invasive species to establish.

DI 10.1111/j.1365-2389.2010.01310.x
AB Although acid soils are common in forest ecosystems, and there is documented evidence of pH influencing transformations of organic matter in soil, there are surprisingly few studies on the influence of soil pH on the chemical structure of physically fractionated soil organic matter (SOM). The aim of this study was to characterize the influence of pH on the chemical and physical processes involved in SOM stabilization. Forest soils of different pH (4.4 and 7.8) sampled from two long-term experiments at Rothamsted Research (UK) were physically fractionated. The free light fraction (FLF), the intra-aggregate light fraction and the fine silt and clay (S + C, <25 mu m) were characterized using elemental, isotopic (delta C-13), thermogravimetric, differential thermal, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and high-resolution magic angle spinning H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. The quantitative distribution of carbon (C) between SOM fractions differed between the two soils. Carbon contents in the light fractions from the acid soil were significantly greater than in those of the alkaline soil. In contrast, in S + C fractions, C content was greater in the alkaline soil. FLF from the acid soil was characterized by a greater C:N ratio, smaller delta C-13 and greater content of thermo-labile compounds compared with FLF from the alkaline soil. In contrast, there was only a weak effect of soil pH on the chemical composition of the organic matter in S + C fractions. Irrespective of soil pH, these latter fractions contained mainly aliphatic compounds such as carbohydrates, carboxylic acid, amide and peptide derivates. This suggested that physical mechanisms, involving the interactions between SOM and mineral surfaces, are of greater importance than the presence of chemically recalcitrant species in protecting SOM associated with the finest soil fractions.

DI 10.1016/j.geoderma.2009.08.002
AB In agricultural systems, soils are subjected to a range of stresses which may affect soil physical and biological properties and compromise the ability of the soil to function. How the soil responds to stress both initially and over time defines resistance and resilience respectively and is key to sustainable soil management. As soil organic matter (OM) is a fundamental soil property, we hypothesised that resilience would be controlled, in part, by this. As soil OM is itself affected by long-term soil management, we therefore sought to establish a direct link between this and resilience to physical and biological stresses. Fifteen soils were taken from a range of arable and grassland sites in England, including the Broadbalk and Highfield long-term experiments at Rothamsted. The soils were subjected to physical (uniaxial compaction stress) or biological (transient heat stress or persistent Cu stress) stresses in the laboratory and the effects on general physical (void ratio) and biological (substrate-induced respiration) functions were monitored over a recovery period of up to 28 days. Wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles were also imposed on the soils following the initial recovery after compression. The initial recovery of void ratio following compression was greater in grassland soils (0.28-0.80) than arable soils (0.16-0.58) which was probably related to the elastic effect of particulate OM and the redistribution of the greater water content in the former soils. Wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles had an additional effect in soils with clay contents greater than 26% The transient heat stress reduced respiration rates in the grassland soils by up to 45%. Grassland soils are less likely to have been subjected to heat stress in the field since they carry a greater vegetation covering than arable soils. The more persistent Cu stress reduced respiration rates in arable soils by up to 85% but only up to 30% in grassland soils. The difference was ascribed to the greater microbial biomass and diversity in grassland soils and buffering by the OM. We defined resistance and resilience indices as the absolute value of the measured soil functions at maximum stress and after the recovery period respectively. Reasonable linear regressions (adjusted R-2 up to 0.68) were established for resistance or resilience as a function of soil OM content used as a proxy index of soil management Expressed in this way, grassland soils were more resistant and resilient to the physical and biological stresses than the arable soils. Linear relationships were also found to link physical and biological resistance and resilience (adjusted R-2 up to 0.96). An arable soil with 65% clay was found to be highly resilient also. We found large differences in physical and biological resilience to stress between arable and grassland soils. We attributed this primarily to the effect of soil management on the OM content although we recognised the importance of clay content. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DI 10.1111/j.1467-7652.2008.00391.x
AB A sulphate deficiency-induced gene, sdi1, has been identified by cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis utilizing field-grown, nutrient-deficient wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Hereward). The expression of sdi1 was specifically induced in leaf and root tissues in response to sulphate deficiency, but was not induced by nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium or magnesium deficiency. Expression was also shown to increase in plant tissues as the external sulphate concentration in hydroponically grown plants was reduced from 1.0 to 0.0 mm. On this basis, sdi1 gene expression has potential as a sensitive indicator of sulphur nutritional status in wheat. Genome-walking techniques were used to clone the 2.7-kb region upstream of sdi1 from genomic DNA, revealing several cis-element motifs previously identified as being associated with sulphur responses in plants. The Arabidopsis thaliana gene most highly homologous to sdi1 is At5g48850, which was also demonstrated to be induced by sulphur deficiency, an observation confirmed by the analysis of microarray data available in the public domain. The expression of Atsdi1 was induced more rapidly than previously characterized sulphur-responsive genes in the period immediately following the transfer of plants to sulphur-deficient medium. Atsdi1 T-DNA 'knockout' mutants were shown to maintain higher tissue sulphate concentrations than wild-type plants under sulphur-limiting conditions, indicating a role in the utilization of stored sulphate under sulphur-deficient conditions. The structural features of the sdi1 gene and its application in the genetic determination of the sulphur nutritional status of wheat crops are discussed.

AB Soil organic matter is important in relation to soil fertility, sustainable agricultural systems, and crop productivity, and there is concern about the level of organic matter in many soils, particularly with respect to global warming. Longterm experiments since 1843 at Rothamsted provide the longest data sets on the effect of soil, crop, manuring, and management on changes in soil organic matter under temperate climatic conditions. The amount of organic matter in soil depends on the input of organic material, its rate of decomposition, the rate at which existing soil organic matter is mineralized, soil texture, and climate. All four factors interact so that the amount of soil organic matter changes, often slowly, toward an equilibrium value specific to the soil type and farming system. For any one cropping system, the equilibrium level of soil organic matter in a clay soil will be larger than that in a sandy soil, and for any one soil type the value will be larger with permanent grass than with continuous arable cropping. Trends in long-term crop yields show that as yield potential has increased, yields are often larger on soils with more organic matter compared to those on soils with less. The effects of nitrogen, improvements in soil phosphorus availability, and other factors are discussed. Benefits from building up soil organic matter are bought at a cost with large losses of both carbon and nitrogen from added organic material. Models for the buildup and decline of soil organic matter, the source and sink of carbon dioxide in soil, are presented.

AB Organically bound sulfur makes up about 90% of the total sulfur in soils, with sulfonates often the dominant fraction. Actinobacteria affiliated to the genus Rhodococcus were able to desulfonate arylsulfonates in wheat rhizospheres from the Broadbalk long-term field wheat experiment, which includes plots treated with inorganic fertilizer with and without sulfate, with farmyard manure, and unfertilized plots. Direct isolation of desulfonating rhizobacteria yielded Rhodococcus strains which grew well with a range of sulfonates, and contained the asfAB genes, known to be involved in sulfonate desulfurization by bacteria. Expression of asfA in vitro increased > 100-fold during growth of the Rhodococcus isolates with toluenesulfonate as sulfur source, compared with growth with sulfate. By contrast, the closely related Rhodococcus erythropolis and Rhodococcus opacus type strains had no desulfonating activity and did not contain asfA homologues. The overall actinobacterial community structure in wheat rhizospheres was influenced by the sulfur fertilization regime, as shown by specific denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments, and asfAB clone library analysis identified nine different asfAB genotypes closely affiliated to the Rhodococcus isolates. However, asfAB-based multiplex restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)/terminal-RFLP analysis of wheat rhizosphere communities revealed only slight differences between the fertilization regimes, suggesting that the desulfonating Rhodococcus community does not specifically respond to changes in sulfate supply.

AB Previous work has shown that the national average quality of the UK wheat crop from 1974 to 1999 was associated with the preceding winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The association of the winter NAO with the grain quality measure, specific weight, was shown to be mediated by Sunshine duration during grain filling and unconditional wet day probability during grain ripening (the probability of a wet day following either a dry or a wet day), The present study tests the hypothesis that the association between specific weight and the winter NAO can be detected in data from 158 years of the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted in south-east England. Specific weight from the Broadbalk Experiment responded to sunshine duration during grain filling and unconditional wet day probability during grain ripening in a similar way to the national average data. An association with the winter NAO was found in the Broadbalk data from 1956 to 2001, but not in the previous 112 years (1844-1955). This finding is consistent with other work showing significant correlations between the winter NAO and summer climate only in recent decades. It is concluded that the association between wheat quality and the NAO is a recent phenomenon.

AB Dried soil samples from many sources have been stored in archives world-wide over the years, but there has been little research on their value for studying microbial populations. Samples collected since 1843 from the Broadbalk field experiment on crop nutrition at Rothamsted have been used to document changes in the structure and composition of soils as agricultural practices evolve, also offering an invaluable record of environmental changes from the pre- to post-industrial era in the UK. To date, the microbial communities of these soils have not been studied, in part due to the well-documented drop in bacterial culturability in dried soils. However, modern molecular methods based on PCR amplification of DNA extracted directly from soil do not require bacterial cells to be viable or intact and may allow investigations into the legacy of bacteria that were present at the time of sample collection. In a preliminary study, to establish if dried soils can provide a historical record of bacterial communities, samples from the Broadbalk soil archive dating back to 1868 were investigated and plots treated with either farmyard manure (FYM) or inorganic fertilizer (NPK) were compared. As anticipated, the processes of air-drying and milling greatly reduced bacterial viability whilst DNA yields declined less and may be preserved by desiccation. A higher proportion of culturable bacteria survived the archiving process in the FYM soil, possibly protected by the increased soil organic matter. The majority of surviving bacteria were firmicutes, whether collected in 2003 or in 1914, but a wide range of genera was detected in DNA extracted from the samples using PCR and DGGE of 16S rRNA genes. Analysis of DGGE band profiles indicated that the two plots maintained divergent populations. Sequence analysis of bands excised from DGGE gels, from a sample collected in 1914, revealed DNA from alpha- and beta-proteobacteria as well as firmicutes. PCR using Primers specific for ammonia oxidizing bacteria showed similar band profiles across the two treatments in recently collected samples, however older samples from the NPK plot showed greater divergence. Primers specific for the genus Pseudomonas were designed and used in real-time quantitative PCR to indicate that archived soil collected in 1868 contained 10-fold less pseudomonad DNA than fresh soil, representing around 10(5) genomes g(-1) soil. Prior to milling, dramatically less pseudomonad DNA was extracted from recently collected air-dried soil from the NPK compared to the FYM plot; otherwise, the two plots followed similar trends. Overall bacterial abundance, diversity and survival during the archiving process differed in the two soils, possibly due to differences in clay and soil organic matter content. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate that air-dried soils can protect microbial DNA for more than 150 years and offer an invaluable resource for future research. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Selenium (Se) intake has decreased substantially in the UK population since 1970s. To investigate whether Se concentration in wheat grain has changed as a result of yield improvement or environmental changes, we analyzed archived wheat grain from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted, England, which has been run continuously for over 160 years. Wheat grain and soil samples were selected from plots receiving different fertilizer or manure treatments. Grain Se concentration varied from 11 to 236 ngg(-1), with a mean and median of 44 and 32 ngg(-1), respectively. Grain samples from the unfertilized control plot had significantly higher concentrations of Se than those from fertilized or manured plots; the latter received various amounts of S and also had higher grain yield. No significant trends in grain Se concentrations were detected in the fertilized or manured plots, in spite of a dramatic increase in grain yield since the introduction of modem short-straw cultivars in the mid 1960s. In the control plot, grain samples had higher Se concentrations in the periods before 1920 or after 1970 than those during 1920-1970. This temporal pattern mirrored that of SO2 emissions and atmospheric S deposition. Soil Se concentrations showed an increasing trend in all plots over 160 years. The results show that the Se concentration of wheat grain from the Broadbalk experiment was influenced by S inputs from fertilizers and atmospheric deposition, and that improving grain yield through plant breeding has not resulted in a significant decrease in grain Se concentration in the fertilized plots.

AB Increasing the inputs of nutrients has played a major role in increasing the supply of food to a continually growing world population. However, focusing attention on the most important nutrients, such as nitrogen (N), has in some cases led to nutrient imbalances, some excess applications especially of N, inefficient use and large losses to the environment with impacts on air and water quality, biodiversity and human health. In contrast, food exports from the developing to the developed world are depleting soils of nutrients in some countries. Better management of all essential nutrients is required that delivers sustainable agriculture and maintains the necessary increases in food production while minimizing waste, economic loss and environmental impacts. More extensive production systems typified by 'organic farming' may prove to be sustainable. However, for most of the developed world, and in the developing world where an ever-growing population demands more food, it will be essential to increase the efficiency of nutrient use in conventional systems. Nutrient management on farms is under the control of the land manger, the most effective of whom will already use various decision supports for calculating rates of application to achieve various production targets. Increasingly, land managers will need to conform to good practice to achieve production targets and to conform to environmental targets as well.

PG 3675-3689
DI 10.1093/jxb/ern218
AB Increasing demands for productivity together with environmental concerns about fertilizer use dictate that the future sustainability of agricultural systems will depend on improving fertilizer use efficiency. Characterization of the biological processes responsible for efficient fertilizer use will provide tools for crop improvement under reduced inputs. Transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches were used to study the impact of nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) deficiency on N and S remobilization from senescing canopy tissues during grain filling in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum). Canopy tissue N was remobilized effectively to the grain after anthesis. S was less readily remobilized. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolite profiling revealed significant effects of suboptimal N or S supply in leaves but not in developing grain. Analysis of amino acid pools in the grain and leaves revealed a strategy whereby amino acid biosynthesis switches to the production of glutamine during grain filling. Glutamine accumulated in the first 7 d of grain development, prior to conversion to other amino acids and protein in the subsequent 21 d. Transcriptome analysis indicated that a down-regulation of the terminal steps in many amino acid biosynthetic pathways occurs to control pools of amino acids during leaf senescence. Grain N and S contents increased in parallel after anthesis and were not significantly affected by S deficiency, despite a suboptimal N:S ratio at final harvest. N deficiency resulted in much slower accumulation of grain N and S and lower final concentrations, indicating that vegetative tissue N has a greater control of the timing and extent of nutrient remobilization than S.

AB A new model, RothPC-1, is described for the turnover of organic C in the top metre of soil. RothPC-1 is a version of RothC-26.3, an earlier model for the turnover of C in topsoils. In RothPC-1 two extra parameters are used to model turnover in the top metre of soil: one, p, which moves organic C down the profile by an advective process, and the other, s, which slows decomposition with depth. RothPC-1 is parameterized and tested using measurements (described in Part 1, this issue) of total organic C and radiocarbon on soil profiles from the Rothamsted long-term field experiments, collected over a period of more than 100 years. RothPC-1 gives fits to measurements of organic C and radiocarbon in the 0-23, 23-46, 46-69 and 69-92 cm layers of soil that are almost all within (or close to) measurement error in two areas of regenerating woodland (Geescroft and Broadbalk Wildernesses) and an area of cultivated land from the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment. The fits to old grassland (the Park Grass Experiment) are less close. Two other sites that provide the requisite pre- and post-bomb data are also fitted; a prairie Chernozem from Russia and an annual grassland from California. Roth-PC-1 gives a close fit to measurements of organic C and radiocarbon down the Chernozem profile, provided that allowance is made for soil age; with the annual grassland the fit is acceptable in the upper part of the profile, but not in the clay-rich Bt horizon below. Calculations suggest that treating the top metre of soil as a homogeneous unit will greatly overestimate the effects of global warming in accelerating the decomposition of soil C and hence on the enhanced release of CO2 from soil organic matter; more realistic estimates will be obtained from multi-layer models such as RothPC-1.

AB With more than 160 years of contrasting fertilizer regimes, the Broadbalk winter wheat experiment represents a unique experimental resource for studying the effects of long-term fertilizer application on microbial population diversity. Using DGGE and clone library analysis, we report here on eubacterial species diversity (16S rRNA gene) and diversity within two sets of gene products associated with microbial N acquisition: NifH (nitrogen fixation) and AmtB (ammonium transport). Comparisons were made within and between soils treated with mineral N fertilizer, farmyard manure or receiving no fertilizer. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene DGGE profiles showed no clear patterns to qualitatively distinguish bacterial community structure between the three different treatments (P > 0.05), with all samples containing a range of eubacterial taxa similar to those that are characteristic of soil bacteria reported elsewhere. Intra-plot heterogeneity was high and of a similar magnitude to that between treatments. This lack of qualitative between plot differences was echoed in the representative sequences of 16S rRNA, nifH, and amtB genes in the various samples. Taken together, both phylogenetic and functional gene analyses showed bacterial communities in the Broadbalk-trial soil were very stable and relatively non-responsive to long-term management of balanced fertilizer inputs.

AB Sulfonates are a key component of the sulfur present in agricultural soils. Their mobilization as part of the soil sulfur cycle is mediated by rhizobacteria, and involves the oxidoreductase AsfA. In this study, the effect of fertilization regime on rhizosphere bacterial asfA distribution was examined at the Broadbalk long-term wheat experiment, Rothamsted, UK, which was established in 1843, and has included a sulfur-free treatment since 2001. Direct isolation of desulfonating rhizobacteria from the wheat rhizospheres led to the identification of several Variovorax and Polaromonas strains, all of which contained the asfA gene. Rhizosphere DNA was isolated from wheat rhizospheres in plots fertilized with inorganic fertilizer with and without sulfur, with farmyard manure or from unfertilized plots. Genetic profiling of 16S rRNA gene fragments [denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] from the wheat rhizospheres revealed that the level of inorganic sulfate in the inorganic fertilizer was correlated with changes in the general bacterial community structure and the betaproteobacterial community structure in particular. Community analysis at the functional gene level (asfA) showed that 40% of clones in asfAB clone libraries were affiliated to the genus Variovorax. Analysis of asfAB-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprints showed considerable differences between sulfate-free treatments and those where sulfate was applied. The results suggest the occurrence of desulfonating bacterial communities that are specific to the fertilization regime chosen and that arylsulfonates play an important role in rhizobacterial sulfur nutrition.

AB The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted Research in the UK provides a unique opportunity to investigate the long-term impacts of environmental change and agronomic practices on plants and soils. We examined the influence of manure and mineral fertiliser applications on temporal trends in the stable N (N-15) and C (C-13) isotopes of wheat collected during 1968-1979 and 1996-2005, and of soil collected in 1966 and 2000. The Soil delta N-15 values in 1966 and 2000 were higher in manure than the mineral N supplied soil; the latter had similar or higher delta N-15 values than non-fertilised soil. The straw delta N-15 values significantly decreased in all N treatments during 1968 to 1979, but not for 1996-2005. The straw delta N-15 values decreased under the highest mineral N supply (192 kg N ha(-1), year(-1)) by 3 parts per thousand from 1968 to 1979. Mineral N supply significantly increased to straw delta C-13 values in dry years, but not in wet years. Significant correlations existed between wheat straw delta C-13 values with cumulative rainfall (March to June). The cultivar Hereward (grown 1996-2005) was less affected by changes in environmental conditions (i.e. water stress and fertiliser regime) than Cappelle Desprez (1968-1979). We conclude that, in addition to fertiliser type and application rates, water stress and, importantly, plant variety influenced plant delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Hence, water stress and differential variety response should be considered in plant studies using plant delta C-13 and delta N-15 trends to delineate past or recent environmental or agronomic changes.

AB Relationships between weather, agronomic factors and wheat disease abundance were examined to determine possible causes of variability on century time scales. In archived samples of wheat grain and leaves obtained from the Rothamsted Broadbalk experiment archive (1844-2003), amounts of wheat, Phaeosphaeria nodorum and Mycosphaerella graminicola DNA were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Relationships between amounts of pathogens and environmental and agronomic factors were examined by multiple regression. Wheat DNA decayed at approx. 1% yr(-1) in stored grain. No M. graminicola DNA was detected in grain samples. Fluctuations in amounts of P. nodorum in grain were related to changes in spring rainfall, summer temperature and national SO2 emission. Differences in amounts of P. nodorum between grain and leaf were related to summer temperature and spring rainfall. In leaves, annual variation in spring rainfall affected both pathogens similarly, but SO2 had opposite effects. Previous summer temperature had a highly significant effect on M. graminicola. Cultivar effects were significant only at P = 0.1. Long-term variation in P. nodorum and M. graminicola DNA in leaf and rain over the period 1844-2003 was dominated by factors related to national SO2 emissions. Annual variability was dominated by weather factors occurring over a period longer than the growing season.

DI 10.1016/j.jas.2006.04.009
AB Recent archaeological studies of human diet have used stable nitrogen isotope ratios (delta N-15) from human bone collagen to infer the relative importance of terrestrial plant and animal foods. This approach is based on widely observed enrichment of delta N-15 up the food chain, plants having distinctly lower values than the herbivores that consume them. Studies of early farming diets in Britain, Denmark and Germany have tended to detect relatively high delta N-15 values (e.g. c. +9 parts per thousand), interpreted as evidence of a diet largely based on animal products, though arch acobotanical evidence for crop cultivation (e.g. carbonised cereal grain and chaff) is widespread. This paper investigates the impact of manuring on delta N-15 values in modern cereals, and of charring on these cereal values. The results from two long-term experiments demonstrate that manuring significantly raises delta N-15 in cereal grain and chaff. Depending on manuring levels and frequency, it appears that human diets with a major component of such grain would conventionally be interpreted as indicating a largely animal-based diet or a mixed plant/animal diet. Moreover, preliminary analyses of experimentally charred grain and chaff from manured and unmanured conditions are promising for the extraction of reliable ancient delta N-15 values from archaeobotanical cereal remains. The wider implications of these results, and the need for further work, are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To meet economic and environmental demands for about 10 billion people by the mid-21st century, humanity will be challenged to double food production from the Earth's soil and diminish adverse effects of soil management on the wider environment. To meet these challenges, an array of scientific approaches is being used to increase understanding of long-term soil trends and soil-environment interactions. One of these approaches, that of long-term soil experiments (LTSEs), provides direct observations of soil change and functioning across time scales of decades, data critical for biological, biogeochemical, and environmental assessments of sustainability; for predictions of soil productivity and soil-environment interactions; and for developing models at a wide range of scales. Although LTSEs take years to mature, are vulnerable to loss, and have yet to be comprehensively inventoried or networked, LTSEs address a number of contemporary issues and yield data of special significance to soil management. The objective of this study was to evaluate how LTSEs address three questions that fundamentally challenge modern society: how soils can sustain a doubling of food production in the coming decades, how soils interact with the global C cycle, and how soil management can establish greater control over nutrient cycling. Results demonstrate how LTSEs produce significant data and perspectives for all three questions. Results also suggest the need for a review of the state of our long-term soil-research base and the establishment of an efficiently run network of LTSEs aimed at soil-management sustainability and improving management control over C and nutrient cycling.

AB Our aim was to determine whether the soil microbial biomass, which has developed naturally over many years in a given ecosystem, is specially adapted to metabolize the plant-derived substrate C of the ecosystem within which it developed or whether the nature of recently added substrate is the more important factor. To examine this, soils from three sites in close proximity (woodland, grassland and arable from the Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, UK) were each amended with air-dried wheat straw (Triticum aestivum), ryegrass leaves (Lolium perenne) or woodland leaf litter (mainly Quercus robur and Fagus sylvatica) in a fully replicated 3 x 3 factorial laboratory experiment. The initial mineralization rates (evolved CO2-C) were determined during the first 6.5 hours and again, together with the amount of microbial biomass synthesized (microbial biomass C), at 7, 14, 21, 30 and 49 days of incubation. The hourly rate of CO2-C production during the first 6.5 hours was slowest following leaf litter addition, while the added grass gave the fastest rates of CO2-C evolution both within and between soils. Ryegrass addition to the arable soil led to approximately four times more CO2-C being evolved than when it was added to the woodland soil, at an overall rate in the arable soils of 41 mu g C g(-1) soil hour(-1). In each soil, the net amounts of CO2-C produced were in the order grass > straw > leaf litter. In each case, the amount produced by the added leaf litter was significantly less (P < 0.05) than either the added grass or straw. Overall, the trend was for much slower rates of mineralization of all substrates in the woodland soil than in either the arable or grassland soils. During 49 days of incubation in the woodland and grassland soils, the net total amounts of CO2-C evolved differed significantly (P < 0.01), with grass > straw > leaf litter, respectively. In the arable soil, the amounts of CO2-C evolved from added grass and straw were significantly larger (P < 0.01) than from the leaf litter treatment. Our findings indicated that the amounts of CO2-C evolved were not related to soil management or to the size of the original biomass but to the substrate type. The amount of biomass C synthesized was also in the order grass > straw > leaf litter, at all stages of incubation in the woodland and grassland soil. In the arable soil, the same effect was observed up to 14 days, and for the rest of the incubation the biomass C synthesized was in the order grass > straw > leaf litter. Up to three times more biomass C was synthesized from the added grass than from the other substrates in all soils throughout the incubation. The maximum biomass synthesis efficiency was obtained with grass (7% of added C). Overall, the woodland soil was most efficient at synthesizing biomass C and the arable soil the least. We conclude that substrate type was the overriding factor that determined the amount of new soil microbial biomass synthesized. Mineralization of substrate C by soil microorganisms was also influenced mainly by substrate type and less by soil management or size of original biomass.

PG 39-47
DI 10.1016/j.still.2005.11.001
AB Manure is a source of plant nutrients and can make a valuable contribution to soil organic matter (SOM). Two experimental sites were studied on a Halpic Phaeozem soil near Bad Lauchstadt in Germany. The first experiment, called the static experiment, commenced in 1902. The impact of fresh farmyard manure (FYM) (0, 20 and 30 t ha(-1) 2 year(-1)) combined with P, K and N fertiliser application on total organic C (C-T) labile C (C-L), non-labile C (C-NL), total N (N-T) mean weight diameter (MWD) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-unsat) was investigated. The second experiment commenced in 1984 and investigated the effect of extreme rates of fresh FYM applications (0, 50, 100 and 200 t ha(-1) year(-1)) and cropping, or a continuous tilled fallow on the same soil properties. At both sites a nearby grassland site served as a reference. On the static experiment, FYM application increased all C fractions, particularly C-L, where application of 30 t ha(-1) 2 year(-1) increased C-L by 70% compared with no FYM application. Fertiliser additions to the static experiment had a positive influence on C fractions while NT increased from both FYM and fertiliser application. MWD increased as a result of FYM application, but did not reach that of the grassland site. Both fertiliser and FYM application increased K-unsat (10 mm tension) on the static experiment. In the second experiment application of 200 t ha(-1) year(-1) of FYM increased concentrations of C-L by 173% and of C-NL by 80%, compared with no FYM application to make them equivalent to, or greater than the grassland site. A continuously tilled fallow resulted in significant decreases in all C fractions, NT and MWD compared with the cropped site, while K-unsat (10 mm tension) was increased on the 0 and 50 t ha(-1) year(-1) treatments as a result of a recent tillage. There was no difference in K-unsat between the cropped and the continuous tilled fallow at FYM applications of 100 and 200 t ha(-1) year(-1). There were similar significant positive correlations of all C fractions and N-T with MWD on both experimental sites but the relationships were much stronger on the extreme FYM experiment. Weaker relationships of C fractions and N-T with K-unsat (10 mm tension) occurred for the static experimental site but these were not significant for the extreme FYM experimental site. The strongest relationship between C fractions and K-unsat was with C-L. This research has shown that applications of FYM can increase SOM and improve soil physical fertility. However, the potential risk of very high rates of FYM on the environment need to be taken into consideration, especially since the application of organic materials to soils is likely to increase in the future.

AB For many centuries manure application to the soil has been common practice. Organic amendments and fertiliser applications can increase crop yields and soil organic matter (SOM). However, the long-term impacts on soil physical fertility are often neglected. This study was carried out on the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted, UK, established in 1843 on an Aquic/ Typic Paleudalf soil. Application of farmyard manure (FYM), N fertiliser and wheat straw on total organic C (C-T), labile C (C-L) and non-labile C (C-NL), total N (N-T), mean weight diameter (MWD) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-unsat) were studied on wheat (Triticum aestivum) and adjacent woodland and pasture areas. Manure additions, N fertiliser and straw incorporation increased all C fractions, particularly the C-L fraction. The addition of 35 t ha(-1) year(-1) of FYM increased C-T to 2.5 times that of the control (no fertiliser) treatment and C-L to 5 times that of the control. With highest N application and straw returned, C-T increased by 1.3 times and C-L by 1.5 times that of the control treatment. There were linear relationships between rate of N fertiliser applied and all C fractions, with the rate of increase almost double with straw than straw removed. Manure application improved MWD, as did high N fertiliser additions with straw returned. Application of N fertiliser only increased MWD and K-unsat (at 10 mm tension) if straw was returned, while the addition of manure resulted in decreased K-unsat. The highest K-unsat rate was on the high N fertiliser, straw returned treatments. The uncropped areas all had high soil structural stability. Similar relationships occurred between all C fractions and NT and MWD for the high C soils, but relationships were much stronger with C-L than the other C fractions in the low C soils. These results showed that soils with low C concentration are more reliant on C-L for structural stability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Our aim was to compare the soil microbial biomass concentration and its activity (measured as CO2-C evolved) following the rewetting and aerobic incubation of soils which have previously been stored air-dry for different periods. Some of the soils have been stored in the Rothamsted sample archive for 103 years, others were comparable freshly sampled soils following air-drying and rewetting and other soils were stored air-dry for 2 years then rewetted for the work described here. Following air-drying, soil ATP concentrations were variable in recently air-dried soil, comprising about 10-35% of the initial ATP concentrations in fresh soil. Following rewetting, the percentage recovery of ATP increased in all soils by 7 days, then declined to between 73% and 87% of the original ATP concentration in the air-dried soils by day 12. Storage of air-dried soils decreased the ability of the microbial biomass to restore its ATP concentrations. For example, the ATP concentration in a soil sampled from stubbed (i.e. tree seedling, saplings and bushes cut frequently to ground level) grassland of the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiment at Rothamsted then air-dried for 2 years was only about 14% of that in the fresh soil at 2 days after rewetting. In other soils from the Hoosfield Barley Experiment, also at Rothamsted, previously given NPK or FYM since 1852, and sampled then stored air-dry for between 13 and 83 years, from 52% to 57% of the ATP in the comparable fresh soils was measured at two days after rewetting. The soil ATP concentration then changed little more up to 12 days. One of the most interesting findings was that while the microbial biomass ATP concentration in the above NPK soils only ranged from about 2 to 4 mu mol ATP g(-1) biomass C, in the FYM soil the microbial biomass ATP concentrations (range 11.5-13.6 mu mol ATP g(-1) biomass C) were the same as we repeatedly measure in fresh moist aerobic soil. We do not yet know the reasons for this. More than twice as much CO2-C was evolved from the long-term stored soils than from freshly sampled ones. However, the specific respiration of the microbial biomass did not change much after the first 12 years of storage, indicating that loss of viability mainly occurred in the earlier years.

AB This paper reviews some traditional and more recent methods for analyzing unreplicated experiments. Such experiments have presented a challenge to statisticians throughout their involvement in agricultural research. At Rothamsted this began in 1919, when R.A. Fisher was appointed to analyze the accumulated data from the classical field experiments. Fisher's experiences with the classicals, which had virtually no replication, must have contributed to his inclusion of replication as one of the key features of a well-designed experiment. Nevertheless, Fisher made good use of Rothamsted's data, for example in his study of the influence of rainfall on yields from the Broadbalk. He also devised the randomization test, which can be used to analyze unreplicated data. More recently, Broadbalk has also been used to study climate change and sustainability. Newer developments have been concerned to find alternatives to use, instead of blocking, to take account of the spatial variation within an experiment. The resulting methods for modeling spatial correlations have allowed experimenters to obtain more precise estimates of treatment effects-or to decrease numbers of replicates- and they can also provide reliable analyses of unreplicated treatments.

AB Despite a high energy requirement, the mouldboard plough remains the dominant tillage tool in northwest Europe. The aim of this work was to evaluate the relative influences of soil texture (clay content), soil organic carbon (SOC) and long-term management on soil-specific draught (S), where S is the force per cross-sectional area of worked soil. Measurements were made during autumn 2000 on the then 157-year-old Broadbalk wheat experiment at Rothamsted, UK, where clay contents vary from 19 to 39% and the different cropping history, mineral and organic fertilizer treatments lead to SOC values of 0.7-3.2%. Minimum SOC values increased with increasing clay and were associated with zero or low mineral N inputs, while higher SOC values (> 2%) were associated with long-term applications of farmyard manure (FYM), despite these being on the lighter (< 24% clay) soils. S values ranged between 52 and 142 kPa, with higher values co-located in areas with high clay contents. Contour maps were generated to illustrate the spatial variability of S and show similarity to those for clay. Where FYM had been added, S was 66 kPa compared with 74 kPa where only mineral or no fertilizer was applied on soils of the same texture. Increasing applications of mineral N resulted in relatively small increases in SOC but up to 12% reduction in S.

AB Sulphur K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy was used to quantify S species in humic substance extracts from ten soils from the UK, China and New Zealand, which differ in land use and agricultural management. XANES spectroscopy showed the presence of most reduced (sulphides, disulphicles, thiols and thiophenes), intermediate (sulphoxides and sulphonates) and highly oxidised S (ester sulphates) forms, with the three groups representing 14-32%, 33-50% and 22-53% of the organic S in the humic substance extracts, respectively. Land use had a profound influence on the relative proportions of S species. Well-drained arable soils generally had a higher proportion of organic S present in the most oxidised form than the grassland soils collected nearby, whereas paddy soils showed a more reduced profile due to episodic flooding. In the Broadbalk Classical Experiment at Rothamsted, reversion of an arable system to grassland or woodland in the 1880s resulted in an increase of the most reduced and intermediate S species at the expense of the most oxidised S species. Long-term applications of farmyard manure to an arable plot also shifted S species from the most oxidised to the intermediate and the most reduced species. Sulphur immobilisation and gross mineralisation were determined in seven soils using the S-35 isotope dilution method. Gross mineralisation during a 53-day incubation correlated more closely with the amounts of the most reduced and intermediate S species than with the most oxidised S species, suggesting that the former (C-bonded S) were the main source of organic S for mineralisation in the short-term.

AB We used the PCR to study the presence of two plant pathogens in archived wheat samples from a long-term experiment started in 1843. The data were used to construct a unique 160-yr time-series of the abundance of Phaeosphaeria nodorum and Mycosphaerella graminicola, two important pathogens of wheat. During the period since 1970, the relative abundance of DNA of these two pathogens in the samples has reflected the relative importance of the two wheat diseases they cause in U.K. disease surveys. Unexpectedly, changes in the ratio of the pathogens over the 160-yr period were very strongly correlated with changes in atmospheric pollution, as measured by SO2. emissions. This finding suggests that long-term, economically important, changes in pathogen populations can be influenced by anthropogenically induced environmental changes.

DI 10.1007/s11104-004-1659-4
AB Phosphorus (P) losses from soil to water by erosion and surface runoff have been much studied and quantified. However, P losses by leaching have received much less attention, mainly because, until recently, the quantities involved were not considered to be of environmental significance. Furthermore, P leaching losses, unlike P losses from erosion or surface runoff were not believed to be related to rates of P addition, as inorganic fertilizer or manures. Here we report results from a number of field and laboratory experiments, designed to assess the significance of P leaching losses from soil to water. Annual cumulative total P losses in drainage waters from four UK field sites ranged from about 0.03 to 5 kg P ha(-1) during 2001-2002. Molybdate reactive P ranged from 45-57%, soluble organic P from 10-13% and particulate P from 29-45% of total P on the two sites (Broadbalk and Woburn) where they could be accurately measured. The proportions of these different P forms were comparable in all treatments, including drainage waters from the unfertilised soils and soils receiving long-term applications of farmyard manure or inorganic fertilizer. In all soils, there was indication of an Olsen- (0.5 M NaHCO3-, pH 8.5) extractable P concentration, (termed the Change-Point), where P measured in field drainage waters or in laboratory soil extracts of 0.01 M CaCl2 began to increase linearly as Olsen-P increased. There was also some agreement between drainage water-P or CaCl2-P and the Olsen-P concentration where the Change-Point occurred. This suggests that CaCl2-extractable P may provide an approximate indicator of soil P concentrations above which significant quantities of P may be lost by leaching under field conditions. There were positive linear relationships between soil dithionate-extractable A] and soil organic C with the Change-Point: [Change Point = [(0.049)[Al3+] minus (9.2)(% organic C)] accounting for 93% of the variance in the data. If this relationship holds under further testing it could well be a useful predictor of Change-Points in different soils. Phosphate sorption isotherms were used to study the soil P concentrations above which P was at risk of moving from soil to water. They showed that soil solution P concentrations were significantly lower between pH 6.9-7.2 than between pH 7.7-8.1, with implications for P loss from soil to water.

PG 161-164
AB Candidate genes from winter wheat plants grown on the Broadbalk field experiment at Rothamsted, UK were evaluated for specificity and quantitative expression in relation to N, S, P, K and Mg status using cDNA-AFLP technology. Some 235 cDNA fragments representing potentially specific deficiency-induced genes were isolated and analysed. Reverse northern and northern blotting were utilized to eliminate false positive clones prior to promoter cloning. One of the 235 clones screened proved to be sufficiently specific to be useful as an S-deficiency marker. This gene, designated sdi1 (sulfur deficiency inducible), was highly specific in its expression to both field and laboratory-grown S-deficient plants. No expression could be detected under any other agronomically important nutrient deficient conditions tested (N, P, K and Mg). The gene showed a quantitative decrease in expression as external sulfate concentrations increased from 0 to 1 mM in laboratory-grown plants. Full length gene cloning showed that sdi1 consists of 1393 bp and encodes a protein of 315 amino acids.

AB This paper describes the application of microarray technology to field-grown wheat in response to sulfur nutritional status. Microarray chips containing 10 000 unigenes identified from 26 different wheat EST libraries were produced. Transcriptome profiles were presented from the Broadbalk winter wheat experiment at Rothamsted, UK showing how sulfur deficiency influences gene expression in the developing grain. Large numbers of genes were both up- and down-regulated. Analysis of genes revealed aspects of metabolism involved in response to nutrient deficiencies and provides individual genes and profiles of expression, which are both diagnostic for the deficiencies and prognostic for yield.

AB Nitrogen is the major determinant of crop yield and quality and the precise management of nitrogen fertilizer is an important issue for farmers and environmentalists. Despite this, little is known at the level of gene expression about the response of field crops to different amounts and forms of nitrogen fertilizer. Here we use expressed sequence tag (EST)-based wheat microarrays in combination with the oldest continuously running agricultural experiment in the world to show that gene expression is significantly influenced by the amount and form of nitrogenous fertilizer. In the Broadbalk winter wheat experiment at Rothamsted in the United Kingdom and at three other diverse test sites, we show that specific genes have surprisingly different expression levels in the grain endosperm when nitrogen is supplied either in an organic or an inorganic form. Many of the genes showing differential expression are known to participate in nitrogen metabolism and storage protein synthesis. However, others are of unknown function and therefore represent new leads for future investigation. Our observations show that specific gene expression is diagnostic for use of organic sources of nitrogen fertilizer and may therefore have useful applications in defining the differences between organically and conventionally grown wheat.

AB Lead-210 chronologies, vertical S concentration gradients and delta(34)S values are presented for 5 Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs located in Central Europe (Rybarenska slat and Ocean Bog; Czech Republic) and the British Isles (Thorne Moors, England; Connemara, Ireland; and Mull, Scotland). Sulfur concentrations were measured in three 40-cm deep peat cores per site, sectioned into 2-cm segments. The coefficient of variation in S concentrations was low across all depths and sites (mean of 16%), indicating a high degree of within-site homogeneity in vertical S patterns. Similar S concentration trends and similar delta(34)S trends were found at all study sites. With an increasing peat depth, S concentrations first increased and then decreased. S concentrations peaked in layers which were deposited in ca. 1959, 1907, 1945, 1899 and 1799 at Rybarenska slat, Ocean, Thorne Moors, Connemara and Mull, respectively. Atmospheric S deposition peaked in 1972 in the UK and in 1987 in the Czech Republic. Due to downward S mobility in peat, S concentration maxima were found in layers 59 ( 19) a older that the year of the actual peak in S input. With an increasing depth, the maturating peat substrate at all sites exhibited first a negative delta(34)S shift, resulting from dissimilatory bacterial SO4 reduction, and then a positive delta(34)S shift, which may be related to advancing S mineralization. Minimum delta(34)S values were detected in layers which were deposited in ca. 1988, 1982, 1945, 1940 and 1978. A comparison of historical delta(34)S signatures of atmospheric S in England, measured on archived grain from the Broadbalk experiment (18451994), with delta(34)S values of Thorne Moors peat (1830-1994) also indicated mobility of S in peat. Sulfur mobility in water-logged peat is of concern during the present period of easing industrial pollution because SO4 released from peat-lands may increase the acidity of the output.

DI 10.1016/S1161-0301(03)00039-X
AB This study examined the environmental impact of different nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates in winter wheat production by using a new life cycle assessment (LCA) method, which was specifically tailored to crop production. The wheat production system studied was designed according to,"good agricultural practice". Information on crop yield response to different N rates was taken from a long-term field trial in the UK (Broadbalk Experiment, Rothamsted). The analysis considered the entire system, which was required to produce 1 ton of wheat grain. It included the extraction of raw materials (e.g. fossil fuels, minerals), the production and transportation of farming inputs (e.g. fertilizers) and all agricultural operations in the field (e.g. tillage, harvest). In a first step, all emissions and the consumption of resources connected to the different processes were listed in a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) and related to a common unit, which is 1 ton of grain. Next a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) was done, in which the inventory data are aggregated into indicators for environmental effects, which included resource depletion, land use, climate change, toxicity, acidification, and eutrophication. After normalization and weighting of the indicator values it was possible to calculate summarizing indicators for resource depletion and environmental impacts (EcoX). At N rates of 48, 96, 144 or 192 kg N/ha the environmental indicator "EcoX" showed similar values per ton,of grain (0.16-0.22 Ecox/ton of grain). At N rates of zero, 240 and 288 kg N/ha the EcoX values were 100-232% higher compared with the lowest figure at an N rate of 96 kg N/ha. At very low N rates, 'land use' was the key-environmental-factor, whereas at high N rates 'eutrophication' was the major problem. The results revealed that agronomical optimal arable farming does not necessarily come into conflict with economic and environmental boundary conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved..

Average TP and PP exceeded 1 mg L-1 in about half of the 12 plots receiving superphosphate for the 5 measurements taken between December 2000 and April 2001. Ranging between 33.8% and 87.3% of TP, PP was the largest P fraction in drainage waters, with DOP, ranging from 0.5% to 26.2% of TP, being the smallest fraction. Mean proportions of PP, MRP and DOP in TP in drainage waters were 63.4%, 32.5% and 4.1%, respectively. These findings support previous findings that P losses from soil to drainage waters were much larger than previously thought, and could therefore make a significant contribution to eutrophication.

TI The Broadbalk long-term experiment at Rothamsted: what has it told us about weeds?
SO Weed Science
VL 52
IS 5
PG 864-873
AB The Broadbalk experiment was started in 1843 to investigate the relative importance of different plant nutrients (N, P, K, Na, Mg) on grain yield of winter wheat. Weeds were controlled initially by hand hoeing and fallowing, but since 1964, herbicides have been applied to the whole experiment with the exception of the 18 plots on Section 8. Approximately 130 weed species have been recorded on Broadbalk and about 30 of these are currently recorded annually on Section 8. Detailed weed surveys, conducted from 1930 to 1979, provide a unique 50-yr record, but the relatively small number of frequency categories used (six) poses a limitation on the interpretation of these data for ecological studies. Weed surveys were restarted in 1991 on Section 8. The current assessment method records the presence of individual 2 weed species in 25 random 0.1-m(2) quadrats per plot, which is more appropriate for detecting long-term trends in weed frequencies and population differences between plots. A principal components analysis of the 1991-2002 survey data for 15 species showed clearly the influence of inorganic N fertilizer levels on the frequency of individual species. The frequency of one species (common chickweed) was greatly favored by increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilizer from 0 to 288 kg N ha(-1), others were strongly disadvantaged (e.g., black medic and field horsetail), some were slightly disadvantaged (e.g., common vetch and parsley-piert), and some showed little response to differing N rates (e.g., blackgrass and corn poppy). Other weed investigations include studies on the effects of fallowing on the weed seed bank, seed dormancy and persistence, agroecology, and population dynamics of individual weed species. Recently, molecular approaches have been used to study the genetic diversity of weeds found on Section 8, which is one of the few arable sites in the country where herbicides have never been applied. This site also provides an invaluable reserve for seven nationally rare or uncommon species. Broadbalk continues to act as a valuable resource for weed investigations 160 yr after it was established.

DI 10.1081/LCSS-200026820
AB Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) plants were grown in split pots in three Rothamsted soils with different soil pH values and phosphorus (P) contents. Ammonium addition resulted in higher plant dry weight and P content than comparable nitrate treatments. The pH of soils in the rhizosphere (0.51-mm average thickness) differed from the bulk soil depending on nitrogen (N) form and level. Ammonium application resulted in a pH decrease, but nitrate application slightly increased pH. To examine the effect of rhizosphere acidification on mobilization of phosphate, 0.5 M NaHCO3 extractable phosphate was measured. The lowering rhizosphere pH enhanced the solubility of P in the soil and maybe availability of P to plants. Rhizosphere-P depletion increased with increasing ammonium supply, but when N was supplied as nitrate, P depletion was not related to increasing nitrate supply. Low P status Hoosfield soils developed mycorrhizal infection., and as a result, P inflow was increased. Geescroft soil, which initially had a high P status, did not develop mycorrhizal infection, and P inflow was much smaller and was unaffected by N treatments. Therefore, plant growth and P uptake were influenced by both rhizosphere pH and indigenous mycorrhizal infection.

AB The aim is to assess whether soil microbial biomass carbon (biomass C) could be used as an indicator of environmental change in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Biomass C was measured by fumigation-extraction in soils from two sites at Rothamsted. One was a plot from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, given inorganic fertiliser and chalk, which has been in continuous cultivation for more than 150 yr. The other was a similar sized area, from Geescroft Wilderness, which has been left to revert to woodland since 1885, after being an arable field. Other soil properties (pH, soil organic C and exchangeable cations) were also measured to compare with biomass C. The coefficients of variation (cvs) of the properties measured were calculated for comparison, little difference was found between the cvs for biomass C from each site: cv = 26% for Broadbalk and 23% for Geescroft. The cvs for the other, chemical properties, were mostly < 10% for Broadbalk and generally > 25% for Geescroft, as expected, given the different cultivation histories. Statistical analysis of the variation in biomass C concentration revealed that such measurements would not be valid indicators of environmental change, without processing impossibly large numbers of samples. To decrease the least significant percentage change to less than 5% after three samplings, 320 samples would have to be taken each time. This would be also be true of the other chemical properties in Geescroft Wilderness, where the measured background variation would mask any subtle environmental change. This indicates that, for some properties at least, statistically significant changes will only be detected in the longer term with regular sampling, e.g. 30-40 yr. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The accumulation of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) was measured on two sites on Rothamsted Farm that had been fenced off some 120 years ago and allowed to revert naturally to woodland. The sites had previously been arable for centuries. One had been chalked and was still calcareous; the other had never been chalked and the pH fell from 7.1 in 1883 to 4.4 in 1999. The acidic site (Geescroft wilderness) is now a deciduous wood, dominated by oak (Quercus robor); the calcareous site (Broadbalk wilderness) is now dominated by ash (Fraxinus excelsior), with sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and hawthorn, (Craetagus monogyna) as major contributors. The acidic site gained 2.00 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) over the 118-year period (0.38 t in litter and soil to a depth of 69 cm, plus an estimated 1.62 t in trees and their roots); the corresponding gains of N were 22.2 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (15.2 kg in the soil, plus 6.9 kg in trees and their roots). The calcareous site gained 3.39 t C ha(-1) year(-1) over the 120-year period (0.54 t in the soil, plus an estimated 2.85 t in trees and roots); for N the gains were 49.6 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (36.8 kg in the soil, plus 12.8 kg in trees and roots). Trees have not been allowed to grow on an adjacent part of the calcareous site. There is now a little more C and N in the soil from this part than in the corresponding soil under woodland. We argue from our results that N was the primary factor limiting plant growth and hence accumulation of C during the early stages of regeneration in these woodlands. As soil organic N accumulates and the sites move towards N saturation, other factors become limiting. Per unit area of woodland, narrow strips; that is, wide, hedges with trees, are the most efficient way of sequestering C - provided that they are not short of N.

TI Stable sulfur isotope ratio indicates long-term changes in sulfur deposition in the broadbalk experiment since 1845
SO Journal of Environmental Quality
VL 32
IS 1
PG 33-39
AB Archived wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain and straw, and soil samples from the control plot of the Rothamsted Broadbalk Experiment, located in southeastern England and established in 1843, were used to investigate the effects of dramatically changing SO2 Pollution inputs on the concentrations and stable isotope ratios (delta(34)S) of S in the samples. Representative coal samples from UK major coal fields were also determined for delta(34)S. Concentrations of S showed no clear trends in either grain or straw over the 155 years from 1845 to 1999. However, grain and straw VS decreased rapidly from 6 to 7parts per thousand in 1845 to -2 to -5parts per thousand in the early 1970s, and since then have increased to 0.5 to 2parts per thousand in the late 1990s. This pattern mirrored the trend of UK SO2 emissions over the 155 years. Both grain and straw delta(34)S correlated strongly and negatively with UK SO2 emissions (R-2 > 0.89), but the relationships were different for the pre- and post-1970 data sets. Soil VS also decreased considerably, from 8.2parts per thousand in 1865 to 3.7 to 4.5parts per thousand during 1965-1999. A negative delta(34)S value was inferred for the anthropogenic S deposited at the experimental site before 1970, and further confirmed by negative delta(34)S values (-6 to -10parts per thousand) found in the coal samples from southeastern England and southern Wales. Based on the S isotope ratios, we estimated that anthropogenic S contributed 62 to 78% of the S uptake by wheat at the peak Of SO2 emissions, and accounted for 28 to 37% of the topsoil S in 1965.

PG 235-251
AB The effects of acidification on the soil chemistry and plant availability of the metals Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Mn and Ni in new and archived soil and plant samples taken from the >100-year-old experiments on natural woodland regeneration (Geescroft and Broadbalk Wildernesses) and a hay meadow (Park Grass) at Rothamsted Experimental Station are examined. We measured a significant input of metals from atmospheric deposition, enhanced under woodland by 33% (Ni) to 259% (Zn); Pb deposition was greatly influenced by vehicle emissions and the introduction of Pb in petrol. The build up of metals by long- term deposition was influenced by acidification, mobilization and leaching, but leaching, generally, only occurred in soils at pH<4. Mn and Cd were most sensitive to soil acidity with effective mobilization occurring at pH 6.0-5.5 (0.01 M CaCl2), followed by Zn, Ni and Cu at pH 5.5-5.0. Pb was not mobilized until pH<4.5. Acidification to pH 4 mobilized 60-90% of total soil Cd but this was adsorbed onto ion exchange surfaces and or complexed with soil organic matter. This buffering effect of ion exchange surfaces and organic matter in soils down to pH 4 was generally reflected by all the metals investigated. For grassland the maximum accumulation of metals in herbage generally corresponded to a soil pH of 4.0. For woodland the concentration of Pb, Mn and Cd in oak saplings (Quercus robur) was 3-, 4- and 6-fold larger at pH 4 than at pH 7. Mature Oak trees contained 10 times more Mn, 4 times more Ni and 3 times more Cd in their leaves at pH 4 than at pH 7. At pH values <4.0 on grassland the metal content in herbage declined. Only for Mn and Zn did this reflect a decline in the plant available soil content attributed to long-term acid weathering and leaching. The chief cause was a long-term decline in plant species richness and the increased dominance of two acid-tolerant, metal-excluder species.

TI Are weed population dynamics chaotic?
SO Journal of Applied Ecology
VL 39
IS 5
PG 699-707
AB There have been suggestions that the population dynamics of weeds may show chaotic dynamics, and that therefore it will not be possible to predict the impact of changing management regimes on weed abundance. The instability of weed populations is presumed to result either from overcompensating yield-density responses or from threshold management. Using theoretical arguments and empirical evidence we argue that this contention is likely to be incorrect. Overcompensating yield-density responses are unlikely in plant populations and this point has been extensively discussed. Such responses have only been observed in high-density artificially sown stands of weed populations. The form of chaos that results from threshold management is a consequence of high population growth resulting from the cessation of management when weed densities are lower than a threshold level. Consequently the dynamics of such populations may be argued to be extrinsically rather than intrinsically driven.There are many studies that have shown weed populations to be dynamically stable, both spatially and temporally. Here we present an analysis of data from the Broadbalk experiment that demonstrates long-term stability of 12 species of common weeds over a 12-year period. Using parameter estimates derived from the literature we show that the stability of these populations is similar to other annual species, both weedy and non-weedy. We argue that weed population dynamics are more generally better viewed as resulting from the impacts of broad-scale types of management, as well as temporal variability in population numbers. The significance of chaotic dynamics is likely to be minimal.

TI Vegetation changes during 100 years of development of two secondary woodlands on abandoned arable land
SO Biological Conservation
VL 101
IS 3
PG 291-304
AB Broadbalk and Geescroft Wildernesses were abandoned as arable fields in the 1880s and allowed to develop with little further direct human intervention. Both have now developed into mature mixed deciduous woodland, variants of National Vegetation Classification type W8, Fraxinus excelsior - Acer campestre - Mercurialis perennis woodland. In addition, a portion of Broadbalk Wilderness has been maintained as grassland by removing woody colonists and, latterly, by grazing. The succession from arable to woodland has been recorded at irregular intervals for more than 100 years. Despite its limitations, this is the longest record of the floristic development of secondary woodland on farmland in the UK. Woody species colonised Broadbalk within 10 years, but at Geescroft they were not recorded until 30 years after abandonment. At present, both sites have good overstorey canopies with well developed understories which provide densely shaded conditions. There are currently 17 species of shrubs and trees at each site. The transition from a flora of mainly light-demanding species to shade tolerant species took place within 20-40 years of abandonment. The development of the shade flora within the woods has been characterised by: (1) a high turnover of species; (2) a failure to colonise by some shade-bearing species in the vicinity; and (3) inability of some colonists to spread beyond the wood margins. This appeared to be associated with: (1) dense shade from the closed woodland canopy; (2) competition from established ground flora dominants, particularly Hedera helix; (3) lack of suitable moist soils and open space habitats within the woods; and (4) pronounced acidification of soils in one wood. Some implications for new farm woodland creation are discussed. Crown Copyright  2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL 33
IS 12-13
PG 1797-1804
AB Sulphur transformations were monitored in a unique set of arable, grassland and woodland soils from the Broadbalk Classical Experiment, which started in 1843. In an open incubation experiment with periodic leaching, 14-35 mg SO42--S kg(-1) was mineralised in 28 weeks at 25 degreesC, equivalent to 4.4-8.3% soil organic S. Cumulative amounts of S mineralised increased linearly during the 28 weeks, indicating constant rates of mineralisation. The rate of mineralisation was the greatest in the woodland soil (170 mug SO4-S kg(-1) day(-1)), followed by the grassland (120 mug SO4-S kg(-1) day(-1)) and the arable soil from the farmyard manure (FYM) plot (110 mug SO4-S kg(-1) day(-1)). Three soils from arable plots receiving different inorganic fertiliser treatments but no FYM had similar rates of S mineralisation (similar to 70 mug SO4-S kg(- 1) day(-1)). an incubation experiment with 35SO(4)(2)(-), addition of glucose greatly enhanced S immobilisation. In 132 days, the woodland and grassland soils immobilised more S than the arable soils, with or without glucose amendment. Immobilisation and mineralisation of S occurred concurrently, and both were stimulated by glucose addition. The results show that S mineralisation and immobilisation were influenced strongly by the type of land-use and long-term organic manuring, whereas annual application of sulphate-containing fertilisers for over 150 years had few effects on short-term S transformations.

TI Relationship between soil test phosphorus and phosphorus release to solution
SO Soil Science
VL 166
IS 2
PG 137-149
AB Continued fertilizer applications in excess of those required for optimum plant growth can increase soil phosphorus (P) concentration and the potential for P movement to surface waters, which can contribute to freshwater eutrophication, Although soil test methods were developed for soil fertility assessment and fertilizer recommendations, they are frequently used for environmental risk assessment because of a lack of consensus on what constitutes a technically defensible environmental soil P test. Several studies have found soil test P (STP) is related to the concentration or release of P into soil solution-overland, subsurface, or drainage flow-by two linear relationships of significantly different slopes (P < 0.05) on either side of a change point for a limited number of soils. Thus, we investigated the existence and behavior of a change point in soil P release for a wide range of variously managed soils from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States, The soils varied in pH (3.0-8.2), organic C (1-172 g kg(-1)), and P (2-173 mg kg(-1) as 0.5M NaHCO3 extractable P (Olsen P) and 21-553 mg kg(-1) as Mehlich-3 P), Soil P release was determined by CaCl2 extraction (5:1 solution to soil ratio for 30 min). For all soils, CaCl2-P increased with STP as either Olsen or Mehlich-3 P (representing a quantity/intensity relationship typical of sorption-desorption isotherms). Statistically significant (P < 0.05) change points for Olsen P occurred in most soils (20-112 mg P kg(-1)) and for Mehlich-3 P for the United States soils (120-190 mg P kg(-1)). Soil P release (CaCl2-P) increased at a greater rate per unit STP increase above these change points than below, Where no change point was detected, it was found that sampled soils were either of low or high P saturation and, thus, were grouped below or above the change point. The change point could be estimated to within 40% of the determined value with a minimum of eight randomly selected samples (4 on either side of the change point).

TI Organochlorine pesticide residues in archived UK soil
SO Environmental Science & Technology
VL 35
IS 10
PG 1989-1995
AB Archived background soils ("Broadbalk', 1944-1986) and sludge- amended soils ("Luddington", 1968-1990), collected from long- term agricultural experiments in the UK, were analyzed for a range of organochlorine (OC) pesticides to establish trends over time. Concentrations typically ranged from 0.1 to 10 ng g of soil (dry weight), with gamma -hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma -HCH), dieldrin, and p,p'-DDE consistently having the highest concentrations. The trends in the Broadbalk background soils are largely consistent with usage patterns, with peak concentrations occurring in the 1960s for DDTs and between the 1960s and the 1980s for the other OCs. In the Luddington control and sludge-amended soils, several of the OCs show a significant decline in concentrations from the late 1960s to 1990, with half-lives ranging from similar to7 years (alpha - HCH) to similar to 25 years (dieldrin). The sludge-amended plot received 125 tonnes of sludge per ha in 1968, which was mixed in to a depth of 15 cm. It appears that the Sludge treatment had little effect on concentrations in the soil, with no significant difference between control soil and sludge-amended soil for most compounds, except for HCB, p,p'-DDE, and dieldrin. Enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of some chiral pesticides (alpha -HCH, cis- and trans-chlordane, and o,p'-DDT) were determined in the Luddington soils. Results reveal that enantioselective degradation of OC pesticides is occurring in these soils for trans-chlordane (TC) and cis-chlordane (CC). However; the depletion over time is not statistically significant, and there is no statistically significant difference between EFs in the control soil and sludge-amended soil. This indicates that enantioselective microbial degradation was not consistent over time and that the addition of sludge to soil did not significantly alter the enantiomeric preference of the microbial community.

TI Polychlorinated naphthalenes in UK soils: Time trends, markers of source, and equilibrium status
SO Environmental Science & Technology
VL 35
IS 21
PG 4205-4213
AB Polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) have been analyzed in archived soil from the U.K. to investigate historical trends. Samples were obtained from the Broadbalk experiment plots (1944-1986) and Luddington experiment station (1968-1990). Luddington samples also include a set of soils that received a one-time sludge treatment in 1968, and duplicate samples of this archived sludge were also analyzed. Peak residues of Sigma PCN (sum of all PCN congeners ;quantified) were similar to 9000 pg g(-1) dry weight in 1956, declining to similar to 300 pg g(- 1) in contemporary soils. The one-time sludge application resulted in elevated soil residues that were 1.5-6 times higher than the control plot over the time series. This increase is consistent with the known application rate and the amount of Sigma PCN in the applied sludge (similar to 250 000 pg g(-1) dry wt). Half-lives for the Luddington control soil and the sludge-amended soil for the period 1972-1990 were 5.3 and 9.9 years, respectively. Investigation of time trends revealed differences between homologue groups with the higher molecular weight congeners peaking earlier in the time series (pre-1950) and the lower molecular weight congeners peaking later, ca. 1970. Time trends of individual congeners were investigated in terms of their relative mass percent contribution to the sum of their homologue group. Significant (p < 0.05) increasing trends were observed for several congeners associated with combustion sources (CN-29, -51, -52 60, -54, and -66 67) suggesting that combustion related sources are more important now than they were in the past. However, no decreasing trend was observed for congeners that were thought to be susceptible to degradation by photolysis suggesting that this may not be a key elimination pathway of PCNs in the environment. A simple calculation of the fugacity status of PCNs in air and soil showed that the tri-CNs are exhibiting net outgassing, while the penta-CNs are still being deposited to soil. Interestingly, the penta-CNs associated with combustion show the largest gradient for air- to-soll transfer, supporting the notion that combustion sources are important contributors to contemporary air burdens of these congeners.

TI Trends in 13C/12C ratios and C isotope discrimination of wheat since 1845
SO Oecologia
VL 128
IS 3
PG 336-342
AB Archived wheat grain and straw samples from the unfertilized plot of the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted, England, were used to investigate the trends in stable C isotope ratios since 1845. Grain delta 13C was higher than straw delta 13C. Both grain and straw delta 13C have decreased by approximately 2.5-2.8 per mil over the last 153 years, and since the 1960s the decrease has been more rapid than the decrease of the delta 13C of atmospheric CO2. The C isotope discrimination ( DELTA ), and hence the ratio of CO2 concentration in leaf intercellular space to that in the ambient air (ci/ca), remained relatively stable or decreased slightly between 1845 and the mid-1960s, then increased considerably. The period with increasing DELTA and ci/ca corresponds to the introduction of the modern short-straw cultivars of wheat. When grown on the unfertilized plot in the same seasons, a modern wheat cultivar had slightly higher DELTA values than an old cultivar. The ci derived from both grain and straw DELTA have increased by 33-37% over the last 153 years, with the increase being more rapid after than before the mid-1960s. However, there was no clear trend in the yields of straw and grain, primarily because of the limitations of N and other nutrients, and also because of large year-to-year variations.

TI Phosphorus content in soil, uptake by plants and balance in three European long-term field experiments. Modelling refractory soil organic matter
SO Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems
VL 56
IS 3
PG 263-275
AB The fate of phosphorus (P) derived from mineral fertilisers and organic manures, and the effective P balance, have been assessed in three long-term field experiments at Rothamsted (UK), Bad Lauchstaedt (Germany) and Skierniewice (Poland). This paper discusses the plant availability, uptake and overall utilisation of P over the last 30 years, based on soil test P 'availability indices' and crop analyses determined by the standard methods used in each of the three countries. The data suggest that differences in soil type significantly influence the dynamics of P at the three locations, but most significantly between a loess Chernozem at Bad Lauchstaedt with a high organic matter content and the soils at the other two locations which have a low organic matter content. The application of P either as inorganic fertiliser or organic manure had a considerable influence on the availablity, uptake, leaching or fixing of P, but the crop recovery rate of P from mineral fertiliser did not exceed 35% with the smallest recovery (average 18%) occurring in the soil with the highest clay content at Rothamsted. At Bad Lauchstaedt and Rothamsted the most efficient utilisation of P (averages of 47% and 37%, respectively) was from soils treated with farmyard manure (FYM), with the greater quantity of P either leached or fixed (8 and 25 kg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively) occurring in soils treated with superphosphate. At Skierniewice, however, the reverse was true. Overall, the most efficient crop utilisation from mineral P (30% average) was from the loamy sand at Skierniewice. P balances for the three locations show that quantitatively, for the same P input, the amount of P either leached from or fixed in the plough layer of Broadbalk field, Rothamsted, was 2-3 times greater than at Skierniewice and 3-6 times greater than at Bad Lauchstaedt. The results suggest that differences in the soil physico-chemical properties, climate, the availability of other major nutrients, and the form in which P is applied, all influence the effectiveness of P fertilisation and P balance. The investigation highlights the importance of maintaining long-term field experiments and archived soil and crop samples on a world-wide basis for understanding nutrient cycling and fertility dynamics. Most models for the turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) include a compartment that is either considered inert, or has a very slow turnover time (refractory SOM; RSOM), The RSOM content of soils varies markedly between sites, and knowledge of its size and variability are essential for determining whether soils behave as sources or sinks of atmospheric CO2, It has also been suggested that the accurate specification of RSOM pools is essential to modelling studies, and that uncertainty in estimates of the size of RSOM pool could be a major source of error in modelling soil organic C, In this paper, current SOM models are reviewed, and approaches to modelling RSOM and its significance are discussed. Simulations of SOM turnover for the Rothamsted Broadbalk winter wheat experiment using the Rothamsted C model and CENTURY are presented as examples.

AB Lipid extracts from four long-term experiments (Broadbalk Wilderness, Geescroft Wilderness, Hoosfield Spring Barley and Park Grass) were analysed using a combination of gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The lipid content of the primary organic inputs for each soil were also analysed in order to assess the early diagenetic fate of the various compound classes present. Soil pH was observed to either directly or indirectly, have a significant effect on lipids with a relative increase in abundance of n-alkanes at higher pH (7.31) and a large relative increase in n-alkanoic and omega-hydroxy acids at low pH (3.74). Triacylglycerols exhibited severe losses irrespective of pH. In an arable soil, n-alkanoic acids showed a temporal decrease in concentration whilst levels of n-alkanols remained static, the difference was ascribed to a more rapid turnover and possible leachate migration of the n-alkanoic acids. The phytosterol, sitosterol, was observed to rapidly diminish in soils possibly as a result of assimilation by soil dwelling invertebrates. Analysis of 5 beta-stigmastanol (a faecal biomarker) showed that it remained at levels indicative of manuring even after 113 years. Furthermore, analysis of 5 beta-stanyl esters revealed a manuring signal even more persistent than that exhibited by the free stanols. Knowledge of the biogeochemical cycling of lipids in the soil environment will help facilitate understanding of the processes which underpin carbon cycling in soils. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Vill. and Aphanes arvensis L.) growing in the Broadbalk long-term wheat experiment. The experiment is made up of individual plots, to which different fertilizer regimes have been applied annually for more than 150 years. Sixteen polymorphic loci were analysed in the obligate outcrosser A. myosuroides (24 plants sampled on each of four plots); the proportion of total diversity caused by differences between populations (G(st)) was low (0.02). Twelve loci were analysed in the self-pollinating species M. lupulina (24 plants sampled on each of four plots, G(st)=0.12) and S. media (24 plants sampled on each of three plots, G(st)=0.11); and 11 loci in the apomict A. arvensis (24 plants sampled on each of four plots, G(st)=0.19). There was no relationship between the geographic distances separating plots and the genetic distances between samples from the weed populations growing on each plot. Soil fertility had an effect on molecular diversity in S. media: plants growing on low-nitrogen showed divergence from those sampled on high-nitrogen plots, which contained slightly more diversity.

TI Nitrate leaching from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, Rothamsted, UK, as influenced by fertilizer and manure inputs and the weather
SO Soil Use and Management
VL 16
IS 4
PG 244-250
AB Nitrate leaching was measured over the eight drainage seasons spanning nine years (1990-1998) on the 157-year old Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted, UK. The weather pattern of two dry, three wet and three dry years was the dominant factor controlling nitrogen (N) loss. Both the concentration of nitrate in the drainage waters and the amount of N leached increased with the amount of N applied, mostly because of long-term, differential increases in soil organic matter and mineralization. On average, losses of N by leaching were 30 kg ha-1year-1 when no more than the optimum N application was applied and were typical of amounts leached from arable land in the UK. Losses increased significantly in both amounts and as the percentage of N applied for supra-optimal applications of N and from autumn-applied farmyard manure (FYM). Extra spring-applied fertilizer was very effective at increasing yields on plots given FYM in the autumn but at the expense of leaching losses three times those from optimum fertilizer N applications. Losses increased after potatoes because they left significant amounts of mineral N in the soil, and decreased after forage maize because it used applied N more effectively. Losses measured 120 years ago from identical treatments were 74% greater than current losses because of today's larger yields and more efficient varieties and management practices. Average concentrations of nitrate in drainage waters did not exceed the EU limit of 11.3 mg NO3-N litre-1 until supra-optimal amounts of N fertilizer (>150-200 kg ha-1year-1) were applied in spring or FYM was applied in autumn. However, some drainage waters from all plots, even those that have not received fertilizer for >150 years, exceeded the limit when rain followed a dry summer and autumn. Nitrate leaching into waters will remain a problem for profitable arable farming in the drier parts of Eastern England and Europe despite increased N use efficiency.

PG 105-110
AB Previous work showed that at soil P concentrations below 57 mg 0.5 M NaHCO3-extractable P (Olsen P) kg(-1) soil, little P was found in drainage waters collected from tile drains set 65 cm below the soil surface in soils from the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment. Above this soil P concentration (termed the Change-Point) both total P and molybdate-reactive P (MRP) in drainage waters were linearly related to soil Olsen P concentrations. We now need to know if the Change-Point measured on Broadbalk occurs on other soils, and if so, whether a common value applies or if it varies depending upon soil type, management, and site hydrology. We investigated the possibility of 0.01 M CaCl2-extractable P being an indicator of the Change-Point. In all the soils studied, we found that the dynamics of P solubility in CaCl2 closely resembled the dynamics of P solubility in drainage waters of Broadbalk, since very distinct Change-Points occurred under both conditions. However, Change-Points measured following extraction with CaCl2 varied widely between soils, from 10 to 119 mg Olsen P kg(-1) soil. Lysimeter studies showed, with some exceptions, good agreement between Change-Points measured in drainage water and in 0.01 M CaCl2. We therefore suggest that this approach may provide a valid indicator of the soil Olsen P concentration at which significant amounts of P begin to leach from soil to water, provided preferential pathways exist in the subsoil to permit P leaching down the soil profile in drainage water.

SO Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis
VL 31
IS 11-14
PG 1599-1620
AB In the 1950s and 1960s, the near universal aim was to increase food production at almost any cost. The introduction of improved cultivars and chemicals to control weeds, pests and diseases justified the use of more fertilizers. Worldwide, the largest increase was in the use of nitrogen (N), partly because it had the largest effect on yield and partly because large quantities were available once fixed N was no longer required for use in the weapons of war. Many developed countries, however, were comparatively quick to satisfy their food needs by the intensification of local production and imports. Interest then turned to issues related to the impact of this intensified agriculture on the environment. Among the more important issues were the increasing concentrations of nitrate in potable water. Although these increases were, simplistically, related to the increased use of fertilizers, they led to a greater interest in fertilizer use efficiency. Increasing fertilizer use efficiency must be seen as a component of integrated plant nutrient management. Integrated because farmers should consider all nutrient sources available to them when deciding fertilizer rates; management because all decisions will have to be taken at the field level by each farmer. The latter requires guidelines. For N, annual field-specific recommendations will be required because after harvest there is little or no mineral N residue from the fertilizer in the soil to benefit subsequent crops and any nitrate can be readily lost from the soil by leaching and denitrification. For many crops, N use efficiency, determined by the difference method, has improved greatly but there is concern that a significant proportion, perhaps 20% for rainfed cereals and more for paddy rice, of the applied fertilizer N still cannot be accounted for. The difference method for assessing efficiency may not be appropriate for nutrients like phosphorus (P) and potassium(K). Calculating the P or K balance and determining its effect on readily soluble P and K in soil may be more useful. This is because only very small amounts of P and K are usually lost from soil and on many soils, a part, at least, of the residue from each application accumulates as a plant available reserve. Thus;a critical level of readily soluble P and K can be determined for each crop on each soil. The guideline to farmers would be to maintain their soils just above the appropriate critical value and assess the efficiency of different nutrient sources on their ability to maintain readily soluble soil reserves.

PG 129 pp.
AB The papers in this volume were presented at the British Ecological Society symposium held in the Oxford Forestry Institute on 13 July 1999. The aim was to bring together examples of different types of long-term monitoring in the UK. The papers (14) and posters/short papers (3) explore changes in British woods over periods ranging from 5 to 50 years in trees and shrubs, ground flora, invertebrates and birds. The work described deals both with natural processes such as stand dynamics, population cycles, phenology and interactions of plant host and invertebrates; and with human-induced effects - woodland management, air pollution and climatic change. As important as the results of the studies themselves, are the common threads that emerge with respect to the establishment and maintenance of long-term studies, the archiving and publishing of results, and the tension between trying to design systems are simple and might be useful to future researchers. The papers are: The human element in long term woodland studies; Long-term stand change in a near-natural oakwood on Clairinsh Island, Scotland (Mountford, E.

AB Concentrations of amino acids were measured in hydrolysates of manured and unmanured soil samples collected in 1876 and 1959 from the Park Grass experiment, and in 1964 from the Broadbalk Wilderness plots. at Rothamsted, England. Discriminant analysis separated successfully the Park Grass treatment groups after the effect of absolute amino acid concentration had been removed. The same statistical procedure was used to compare samples of soil from the Park Grass and previously published data from the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiments. These comparisons suggest that an amino acid 'fingerprint' can distinguish between grassland and arable treatments. Further comparisons suggest that the Wilderness wooded soil fingerprint is distinguishable from both grassland and arable, but that the Wilderness grassland (rough grass) fingerprint is more like the (Park) grassland than either the Wilderness wooded or the arable fingerprints.

SO European Journal of Soil Science
VL 50
IS 3
PG 401-412
AB We have examined the effect that acid deposition and other sources of acidity have had over the last 110-140 years on soil under woodland (Broadbalk and Geescroft Wildernesses) and grassland (Park Grass) comprising some of the Classical Experiments at Rothamsted Experimental Station. Changes in soil chemistry have been followed by analysing some of the unique archive of stored samples for pH, water-soluble and exchangeable base cations, aluminium, iron and manganese, exchangeable acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and soluble anions. Proton balances and historical data show the importance of acid deposition to acidification and concomitant changes in the chemistry of the soil. The pH of the surface soil of Geescroft Wilderness has fallen from 6.2 to 3.8 since 1883. The decrease in the pH of the unlimed, unfertilized plot on Park Grass was less over a similar period (from pH 5.2 to 4.2), illustrating the significant effect of the woodland canopy on the interception of acidifying pollutants. The effect of increasing acidity on the soil chemistry of Geescroft Wilderness is seen in its decreasing base saturation and CEC, with base cations moving down the soil profile. Clay minerals are being irreversibly weathered, and Mn and Al progressively mobilized, so that today Al occupies 70% of the exchange complex in the surface soil. Even with present reductions in sulphur deposition critical loads for sulphur, nitrogen and acidity are still exceeded. Such semi-natural ecosystems are unsustainable under the current climate of pollution.

SO Soil Biology & Biochemistry
VL 31
IS 5
PG 747-755
AB Denitrification in subsoils may be a natural process able to decrease NO3 contamination of groundwater. We studied this process and how it was affected by long-term fertilization practices. We collected soil to a depth of 2 m from four treatments in the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment, One treatment (FYM) had received manure applications annually since 1843, while the other treatments were NO (0 kg N ha(-1) since 1843), N4 (196 kg N ha(-1) since 1968) and N6 (288 kg N ha(-1) since 1984). Using the acetylene inhibition method, we measured N2O production from anaerobic slurries of either unamended or amended (plus C and NO3) samples of surface soil and three subsoil depth layers. These results will not equate to actual field denitrification rates, but the amended treatments (i.e, plus C and NO3) will indicate the relative denitrification capacities of the soils, Thr unamended treatment will more accurately indicate the relative field denitrification rates. In the surface soils, denitrification Fates were approximately proportional to total organic C (TOC) and they increased in the following order. N0, N4, N6, FYM. In the subsoil, denitrification declined with depth, and at 1.2 m was only a small fraction of that at the surface. There was no relationship between surface soil fertilization practices and either subsoil denitrification capacity, TOC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or total N. Indeed subsoil (60-200 cm) denitrification capacity was not significantly different between treatments. Denitrification capacity in unamended subsoils was not related to DOG. However, there was a significant relationship (R-2 = 0.41) between TOC and denitrification rate. When amended soils were conditioned aerobically for 5 days, N2O production increased, indicating the presence of a small community of denitrifiers which multiplied when given a C source. We conclude that subsoil denitrification has the potential to decrease NO3 concentrations of percolating waters but is in reality limited by biologically available C. On our Broadbalk site, surface soil management had no effect upon the amount of 'available' C in the subsoil. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Predicting nitrate losses from agricultural systems: Measurements and models
SO Managing Risks of Nitrates to Humans and the Environment (Wilson W.S. , Ball A.S. and Hinton R.H. (eds) - Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge)
PG 21-41
AB The aim of this article is to set the background for the discussion of the prediction of nitrate losses and the use of such predictions in decision making. The article discusses measurements and models used to predict water flow and nitrate supply, before drawing both together to consider prediction of nitrate loss. The difficulties and advantages of some of the current approaches to predicting nitrate losses from agricultural systems are highlighted. Models can never be completely independent of measurements. Data are required not only for compilation and evaluation of models but each simulation also requires input data and parameters. The integrated use of both measurements and modelling approaches in the prediction of nitrate losses is therefore advised, with the actual combination of measurements and models controlled by the question to be answered, its scale and the data available. All predictions should be presented in a way that tempers them with an estimate of their reliability, in terms that are readily understood. Where such data are not presented, poor decisions may be made and unacceptable environmental impact or risk may result.

SO Biology and Fertility of Soils

AB The short-term effects of N addition on CH4 oxidation were studied in two soils at Rothamsted Experimental Station, UK. Both sites are unfertilized; one has been under long-term arable rotation, and the other is a grassland that has been cut for hay for the past 125 years. The sites showed clear differences in their capacity to oxidise CH4, the arable soil oxidised CH4 at a rate of 0.013 micro g CH4 kg-1 h-1 and the grassland soil approximately an order of magnitude quicker. In both sites the addition of (NH4)2SO4 caused an immediate reduction in the rate of atmospheric CH4 oxidation approximately in inverse proportion to the amount of NH4+ added. The addition of KNO3 caused no change in the rate of CH4 oxidation in the arable soil, but in the grassland soil after 9 days the rate of CH4 oxidation had decreased from 0.22 micro g CH4 kg-1 h-1 to 0.13 micro g CH4 kg-1 h-1 in soil treated with the equivalent of 192 kg N ha-1. A 15N isotopic dilution technique was used to investigate the role of nitrifiers in regulating CH4 oxidation. The arable soil showed a low rate of gross N mineralisation (0.67 mg N kg-1 day-1), but a relatively high proportion of the mineralised N was nitrified. The grassland soil had a high rate of gross N mineralisation (18.28 mg N kg-1 day-1), but negligible nitrification activity. It is thought that since there was virtually no nitrification in the grassland soil then CH4 oxidation at this site must be methanotroph mediated.

SO Mitteilungen der Deutschen Bodenkundlichen Gesellschaft

AB Most models for the turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) include a compartment that is either considered inert, or has a very slow turnover time. This is usually only a conceptual fraction, included in the models to allow realistic simulation of SOM turnover following changes in land use or management, or to balance the great age of soils as given by radiocarbon dates. Conceptual model pools range from very active pools which have rapid turnover times, to effectively inert pools, which do not turn over on the pedological timescale. In reality SOM is likely to be a mixture of materials of different ages and quality, which may not be readily represented by a number of discrete pools. Current SOM models are reviewed, and model approaches to, and the significance of refractory SOM (RSOM) discussed. Simulations of SOM turnover for the Rothamsted Broadbalk Winter Wheat Experiment using the Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC) and CENTURY are presented as examples.

TI Nitrogen deposition and its contribution to nitrogen cycling and associated soil processes
SO New Phytologist
VL 139
IS 1
PG 49-58
AB Human activity has greatly perturbed the nitrogen cycle through increased fixation by legumes, by energy and fertilizer production, and by the mobilization of N from long-term storage pools. This extra reactive N is readily transported through the environment, and there is increasing evidence that it is changing ecosystems through eutrophication and acidification. Rothamsted Experimental Station, UK has been involved in research on N cycling in ecosystems since its inception in 1843. Measurements of precipitation composition at Rothamsted, made since 1853, show an increase of nitrate and ammonium N in precipitation from 1 and 3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively, in 1855 to a maximum of 8 and 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1980, decreasing to 4 and 5 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) today. Nitrogen inputs via dry deposition do, however, remain high. Recent measurements with diffusion tubes and filter packs show large concentrations of nitrogen dioxide of c. 20 mu g m(-3) in winter and c. 10 mu g m(-3) in summer; the difference is linked to the use of central heating, and with variations in wind direction and pollutant source. Concentrations of nitric acid and particulate N exhibit maxima of 1.5 and 2 mu g m(-3) in summer and winter, respectively. Concentrations of ammonia are small, barely rising above 1 mu g m(-3). Taking deposition velocities from the literature gives a total deposition of all measured N species to winter cereals of 43.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(- 1), 84 % as oxidized species, 79 % dry deposited. The fate of this N deposited to the very long-term Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted has been simulated using the SUNDIAL N-cycling model: at equilibrium, after 154 yr of the experiment and with N deposition increasing from c. 10 kg ha(- 1) yr(-1) in 1843 to 45 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) today, c. 5 % is leached, 12% is denitrified, 30% immobilized in the soil organic matter and 53 % taken off in the crop. The 'efficiency of use' of the deposited N decreases, and losses and immobilization increase as the amount of fertilizer N increases. The deposited N itself, and the acidification that is associated with it (from the nitric acid, ammonia and ammonium), has reduced the number of plant species on the 140- yr-old Park Grass hay meadow. It has also reduced methane oxidation rates in soil by c. 15 % under arable land and 30 % under woodland, and has caused N saturation of local woodland ecosystems: nitrous oxide emission rates of up to 1.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) are equivalent to those from arable land receiving > 200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), and in proportion to the excess N deposited; measurements of N cycling processes and pools using N-15 pool dilution techniques show a large nitrate pool and enhanced rates of nitrification relative to immobilization. Ratios of gross nitrification:gross immobilization might prove to be good indices of N saturation.

TI Fate of N-15-labelled fertilizer in a long-term field trial at Ropsley, UK
SO Journal of Agricultural Science
VL 129
PG 49-63
AB In 1992 and 1993, eight rates of N-15-labelled fertilizer (0-245 kg ha(-1)) were applied to winter wheat growing on the Ropsley long term field trial where eight different N amounts had been applied annually since 1978. The fate of the labelled N in the crop and topsoil (0-23 cm) was determined at harvest in the year of N-15 application and in the first and second residual years. By harvest in the second residual year, 60-77 % of the original labelled application had been recovered in the crop and topsoil with 23-40 % lost. These losses virtually all occurred within the first two growing seasons; there was no significant loss during the second residual year. Significant changes in the N-15 balance were observed at N applications in excess of the range 140-175 kg ha(-1) which suggested a marked decrease in the efficiency of N use and an increase in residual labile N in the soil at harvest. At low N applications (< 175 kg ha(-1)), a positive added nitrogen interaction (ANI) was observed: 40-50 % of this was a residual ANI due to the short or long term effect of applying N fertilizer, and the remainder was probably an apparent ANI due to pool substitution in the immobilization process. At large N applications (> 175 kg ha(-1)) a negative ANI was observed: large N applications resulted in a net suppression of soil N uptake due to substitution by fertilizer for a limited plant N demand.

IS Supplement 23
PG 18-26
AB The relationships between meteorological variables (average monthly maximum and minimum air temperature, total monthly precipitation) and crop yields of a long-term field experiment in southern England were examined to determine whether long-periodic changes in crop yields are associated with climatic variations. The study used the grain and straw yields from 1854 to 1967 of the Broadbalk winter wheat experiment at Rothamsted, UK. The main techniques used to describe the crop/weather relationships were correlation analysis and multiple regression. The results show that the long-term changes in crop yields at Rothamsted were partially related to climate variations at this site. The main influence on grain yields was precipitation. In all months there were negative correlations between grain yield and rainfall. A weak positive correlation was found between precipitation and straw yield from April to June (stem elongation) whereas in the other months the correlation coefficients remained negative. The maximum air temperature was positively correlated with straw yield in all months except May, June and July. Generally it was easier to explain the variability of straw yields by weather variations than that of grain yields. On the basis of simple multiple regression models it was possible to explain 33% of the grain and 50% of the straw yield variability by precipitation and temperature variations. Long-periodic changes in rainfall and temperature were reflected in observed and estimated crop yields.

Experiments to determine the effects of soil-borne pathogens, the effects of P and K accumulated in soil from fertilizers and manures, the efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers, and the fate of nitrogen in organic manures are described. The value of long-term experiments in assessing the effect of soil type and farming systems on soil organic matter is considered. The Park Grass experiment and the Rothamsted Insect Survey are described. The value of long-term experiments with respect to environmental concerns (soil pollution, organic pollutants, inorganic pollutants) is discussed.

AB Aerobic soils are an important sink for methane (CH4) contributing up to 15% of annual global CH4 destruction. However, the sink strength is significantly affected by land management, nitrogen (N) fertilizers and acidity. We tested these effects on samples taken from the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat, Park Grass permanent grassland and Broadbalk and Geescroft Wilderness experiments at Rothamsted. The rates of uptake from the atmosphere of both enhanced (10 ppmv) and ambient (2 ppmv) concentrations of CH4 were measured in laboratory incubations of soil cores under controlled conditions. The most rapid rates of uptake were measured in soil from deciduous woodland at pH 7 (measured in water); acidic (pH 4) woodland soil showed no net CH4 oxidation. While disturbance of the cores used in the experiments did not affect the rate of CH4 uptake, extended (150 years) cultivation of land for arable crops reduced uptake rate by 85% compared to that in the soil under calcareous woodland. The long-term application of ammonium-(NH4) based fertilizer, but not nitrate-(NO3) based fertilizer, completely inhibited CH4 uptake, but the application for the same period of farmyard manure that contained more N than the fertilizer had no inhibitory effect. Although the effects of agricultural practice on the oxidation of CH4 in soil are significant, the differences in oxidation rates between land use types are even greater. The likely effects of forest clearance, agricultural intensification and anthropogenic emissions of CH4 over the last 2500 years have been estimated for the United Kingdom. The calculations indicate that 54% of the current CH4 uptake by UK soils is the result of increased CH4 mixing ratio. They also indicate that land use change has decreased the potential sink strength by 62% or 37 kt CH4 g(-1). In countries with much larger land areas than the UK, such as China, aerobic soil is likely to be a more significant factor in calculating net fluxes of CH4. It is important that the impacts of different agricultural managements and land use systems are understood and quantified so that the best possible estimate of CH4 sinks is calculated for comparison with sources.

AB The transformations of phyllosilicates and the changes in potassium (K) balances caused by long-term cropping have been examined in soil from the 153-year-old Broadbalk experiment. Samples taken between 1856 and 1987 and kept in archive were fractionated for particle size and analysed for changes in mineralogy by X-ray diffraction and changes in total K of the coarser and fine fractions. These were compared with K balances made from records of cropping and fertilizer application. No change in mica due to cropping and K-depletion could be detected. Deep ploughing after 1925 mixed chlorite from the subsoil into the surface soil, but this had weathered by 1987. Potassium balances did not agree with measured changes in total K presumably because of unquantified uptake of K from the subsoil and poorly quantified K leaching.

The plots were chosen specifically for their different types of vegetation cover. Samples of the vegetation were examined in parallel with the underlying soils in an effort to follow the fate of the major plant components in soil. The application of HT-GC and HT-GC-MS allowed changes in high molecular weight lipids, particularly intact acyl lipids, such as triacylglycerols, wax esters, steryl and triterpenyl esters, to be studied in leaf and soil extracts. The total lipid extracts of the soil samples from the wooded area were dominated by the input from leaf-derived lipids. The lipid extracts of soils from the grazed and stubbed areas were markedly different from those from the wooded area, and reflected the mixed vegetation cover dominated by grass species. In marked contrast, the pyrolysis data from the insoluble organic matter and humic fractions of the soils did not reflect the composition of the lignin comprising the overlying vegetation, but rather showed evidence of amino acid moieties probably present as polypeptides. The absence of the lignin signal is possibly due to rapid diagenetic changes presumed to be influenced by the slightly alkaline pH of the soil. The ability to recover recognizable chemical signals from soil lipids has important implications for archaeological investigations aimed at revealing temporal changes in vegetation cover and/or differences in land use at specific site locations.

SO Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems
VL 49
IS 1-3
PG 85-90
AB The rate of methane oxidation has been measured from under a variety of land uses and management practices on Rothamsted Experimental Station. All these sites have their management histories well documented, in many cases over centuries, and experience the same atmospheric inputs. We have found consistent patterns in methane oxidation rates associated with land use, where the rate of methane oxidation in unfertilized arable soil (c. 30 mu g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) is only 15 % that in undisturbed grassland and woodland soils (c. 200 mu g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Investigation of the mechanisms regulating these differences have shown that they are microbially mediated. The microbial basis for differences in methane uptake rates are unclear, but probably involve three groups of microorganism, methanogens, methanotrophs and ammonia oxidisers. Using traditional enumeration techniques we show that soils under grassland and woodland have similar numbers of bacteria and also similar numbers of putative methane oxidisers (organisms of unknown identity, that can oxidise methane), but that an unfertilized arable soil has significant lower total bacterial numbers and also putative methane oxidisers. This study is extended to compare the capacities of the soils under the different land uses to metabolise multi-carbon compounds in addition to methane. Using a modification of the Biolog<reg> technique we demonstrate that the microbial populations in the soil under the woodland and grassland can metabolise a greater range of carbon compounds compared to the arable soil, as well as having higher methane oxidising capabilities.

AB Concentrations of amino acids were measured in hydrolysates of manured and unmanured soils collected in 1881 and 1980 from the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiment at Rothamsted (England), Discriminant analysis successfully separated the treatment groups after the effect of absolute amino acid concentration had been removed. This suggests that it may be possible to identify an amino acid ''fingerprint'' from soils reflecting land use, and which could be used as a basis for classifying soils. This could have the potential for application in archaeology.

TI The effects of long-term applications of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer on soil nitrogen in the Broadbalk wheat experiment
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
VL 127
PG 347-363
AB The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted (UK) includes plots given the same annual applications of inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer each year since 1852 (48, 96 and 144 kg N ha, termed N-1, N-2 and N-3 respectively). These very long-term N treatments have increased total soil N content, relative to the plot never receiving fertilizer N (N-0), due to the greater return of organic N to the soil in roots, root exudates, stubble, etc (the straw is not incorporated). The application of 144 kg N ha for 135 years has increased total soil N content by 21%, or 570 kg ha (0-23 cm). Other plots given smaller applications of N for the same time show smaller increases; these differences were established within 30 years. Increases in total soil N content have been detected after 20 years in the plot given 192 kg N ha since 1968 (N-4). There was a proportionally greater increase in N mineralization. Crop uptake of mineralized N was typically 12-30 kg N ha greater from the N-3 and N-4 treatments than the uptake of c. 30 kg N ha from the N-0 treatment. Results from laboratory incubations show the importance of recently added residues (roots, stubble, etc) on N mineralization. In short-term (2-3 week) incubations, with soil sampled at harvest, N mineralization was up to 60% greater from the N-3 treatment than from N-0. In long-term incubations, or in soil without recently added residues, differences between long-term fertilizer treatments were much less marked. Inputs of organic N to the soil from weeds (principally Equisetum arvense L.) to the N-0-N-2 plots over the last few years may have partially obscured any underlying differences in mineralization. The long-term fertilizer treatments appeared to have had no effect on soil microbial biomass N or carbon (C) content, but have increased the specific mineralization rate of the biomass (defined as N mineralized per unit of biomass). Greater N mineralization will also increase losses of N from the system, via leaching and gaseous emissions. In December 1988 the N-3 and N-4 plots contained respectively 14 and 23 kg ha more inorganic N in the profile (0-100 cm) than the N-0 plot, due to greater N mineralization. These small differences are important as it only requires 23 kg N ha to be leached from Broadbalk to increase the nitrate concentration of percolating water above the 1980 EC Drinking Water Quality Directive limit of 11.3 mg N I. The use of fertilizer N has increased N mineralization due to the build-up of soil organic N. In addition, much of the organic N in Broadbalk topsoil is now derived from fertilizer N. A computer model of N mineralization on Broadbalk estimated that after applying 144 kg N ha for 140 years, up to half of the N mineralized each year was originally derived from fertilizer N. In the short-term, the amount of fertilizer N applied usually has little direct effect on losses of N over winter. In most years little fertilizer-derived N remains in Broadbalk soil in inorganic form at harvest from applications of up to 192 kg N ha. However, in two very dry years (1989 and 1990) large inorganic N residues remained at harvest where 144 and 192 kg N ha had been applied, even though the crop continued to respond to fertilizer N, up to at least 240 kg N ha.

IS No. 44
PG 25-32
AB Natural colonization for establishing multiple-use woodlands was evaluated using historical information and survey results from Broadbalk Wilderness, an area of colonization dating back to 1882, at Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, UK. The Broadbalk Wilderness woodland is of mixed deciduous type and covers a small area (0.15 ha). The 2 dominant tree species over the period reported (1945-95) are hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior), with the main other tree species oak (Quercus spp.), field maple (Acer campestre), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), holly (Hedera helix), wild cherry (Prunus avium) and yew (Taxus baccata). However, sycamore is now the second most abundant tree. The number of trees has increased from 104 in 1960 to 206 in 1995. The main advantages of colonization were that (1) it led to species matched to the site, (2) opportunities for conserving local genetic distinctiveness were maximized, and (3) the impact of the new woodland in the landscape was low due to prolonged, patchy establishment. The main disadvantages were that (1) establishment was unpredictable and slow, (2) without management little timber of any value has been produced, and (3) floral diversity was low on the site due to isolation from surrounding woodland. It is concluded that natural colonization has a role to play in creating new woodlands but that it should be driven by clear objectives and applied flexibly in relation to site characteristics.

AB Long-term experiments like those at Rothamsted in southeast England offer the best practical means of studying the effects of land management or global change on soil fertility, sustainability of yield or wider environmental issues. For the data from such experiments to be of use, farmers, scientists and policy makers must be certain of their validity. This is best assured by the rigorous management of the experiment, by ensuring that any changes are carefully considered and that all operations are well-documented. A steady flow of well- interpreted, published data is also essential. This paper gives examples of how the long-term field experiments at Rothamsted have been managed and how modifications have been made to ensure their relevance to modem agriculture.

AB Maintaining soil fertility and sustaining or increasing crop yield is of worldwide importance. Many factors impact upon the complex biological, chemical and physical processes which govern soil fertility. Changes in fertility caused by acidification, declining levels of organic matter, or P and K status may take many years to appear. These properties can in turn be affected by external influences such as atmospheric pollution, global change, or changes in land management practice. Long-term experiments provide the best practical means of studying changes in soil properties and processes and providing information for farmers, scientists and policy makers. This paper shows how the experiments run at Rothamsted in southeast England continue to provide data which are highly relevant to today's agriculture and wider environmental concerns. Examples are given of how crop yield is affected by soil organic matter, by pests and disease and by P nutrition. The effect of atmospheric pollution on soil acidity and the mobilization of heavy metals are also examined. The need for making better use of existing long-term experiments is stressed.

AB We followed in situ the evolution of nitrogen recently incorporated into a soil under maize culture for 4 years. Each year, a different pair of plots treated by removal or return of maize crop residues received a single pulse of N-15-labelled fertilizer. Unlabelled fertilizer was otherwise supplied. In parallel, plots supplied with unlabelled fertilizer received a single pulse of N-15-labelled maize crop residues. Varying weather affected total and fertilizer-derived N in the crop and residual inorganic N in the topsoil, but it did not affect fertilizer-N immobilization and remineralization. There was no consistent effect of crop residue return on total soil N, immobilization of fertilizer N, or the decay kinetics of recently immobilized N. Recently incorporated organic N from crop residues and microbial immobilization of inorganic N displayed similar mid-term decay kinetics. Crop residue N and immobilized N enter a labile compartment with an average residence time of a few months. A proportion, estimated at 28%, enters a more stable compartment from which the mineralization was imperceptible in 4 years. Particle-size fractions >50 mu m, which receive most of the crop residue N, retained it for only a short time. The mid-term stabilization of N was mainly in soil fractions <50 mu m.

SO Mycological Research
VL 99
PG 1391-1394
AB Populations of Fusarium spp. from plots growing continuous winter wheat were estimated by dilution plating of soil samples taken in February, April and July 1993. The plots, from two sections of Broadbalk field, Rothamsted, either had the straw removed, or chopped and incorporated into the soil after every harvest since 1986; the plots also bad different fertilizer treatments. Most species were more abundant in July than in February or April. Estimated propagule numbers of F. culmorum, the only cereal pathogen found frequently, were less than in a survey of the same plots in 1964. It occurred in greatest numbers in plots treated with farmyard manure and, in July, with the largest inorganic nitrogen applications. F. oxysporum and F. solani, non-pathogenic on cereals, were mast frequent in plots treated with phosphorus, potassium and magnesium but without added nitrogen. Other non-pathogenic species, of which the most abundant was F. merismoides, showed no consistent response to any of the fertilizer treatments. The method of straw disposal had no consistent effects. The results are discussed in relation to perceived changes in fusarium disease in the U.K. and changing cereal husbandry practices.

VL 73
IS 1-2
PG 43-66
AB This study examines the relationships between meteorological variables (average monthly maximum and minimum air temperature, total monthly precipitation) and crop yields of a long-term field experiment in southern England. The aim is to determine whether the long-periodic changes in crop yields are associated with climatic variations. This investigation uses the grain and straw yields (from 1854 to 1967) of the Broadbalk winter wheat experiment at Rothamsted, UK, which is one of the oldest agricultural field experiments in the world. In this study the main techniques used to describe the crop weather relationships are correlation analysis and multiple regression. The results show that the long-term changes in crop yields at Rothamsted are partially related to climate variations at this site. The main influence on grain yields is precipitation. In all months there are negative correlations between grain yield and rainfall. A weak positive correlation is found between precipitation and straw yield from April to June (stem elongation) whereas in the other months the correlation coefficients remain negative. The maximum air temperature is positively correlated with the straw yield in all months except May, June and July. Generally it is easier to explain the variability of straw yields by weather variations than it is that of grain yields. On the basis of simple multiple regression models it is possible to explain 33% of the grain and 50% of the straw yield variability by precipitation and temperature variations. Long periodic changes in rainfall and temperature are reflected in estimated crop yields. The lowest grain and straw yields are observed in wet cold as well as in wet warm years whereas the highest grain yields are more frequent in dry or cold years and the highest straw yields in dry or warm years.

PG 25923-25931
AB Losses of fertilizer as NO and N2O were studied at Broadbalk field, Rothamsted Experimental Station in England, on which subplots have been subject to differing constant levels of fertilizer application for many years. Fluxes of NO and N2O were measured using open- and closed-chamber techniques, respectively. Fluxes from unfertilized soil ranged from 0.3 to 4.8 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for NO and 0.23 to 3.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for N2O. The corresponding fluxes from the plot with the highest fertilizer application (92 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as NH4NO3) ranged from 0.5 to 64 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for NO and 0.4 to 240 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for N2O. Application of increasing amounts of fertilizer substantially enhanced emission rates of both NO and N2O. However, the amount of increase was controlled by competition between the crop and the microorganisms for the available soil nutrients, and loss of N2O to the atmosphere increased sharply at superoptimal levels of fertilizer application. The fertilizer-derived NO and N2O emissions represented approximately 90% of the total emission of these gases during the 25-day sampling period after fertilizer application. The results suggest that while increasing the amount of fertilizer increases both NO and N2O fluxes simultaneously, the NO N2O emission ratio decreases. Results from laboratory experiments showed that the magnitude of the fertilizer loss as N2O was strongly affected by the form of the applied fertilizer.

AB Total P (TP), total particulate P (TPP), dissolved reactive P (DRP), and dissolved organic P (DOP) were determined in waters from pipe-drains (at 65-cm depth) from the Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted. Soils that have received either no P, P in farmyard manure (about 40 kg P ha(-1)) or superphosphate (up to 35 kg P ha(-1)) annually for >150 yr, now contain 0.5 M NaHCO3- extractable P concentrations (Olsen-P) in the plow layer (0- to 23-cm depth) between 5 and 100 mg kg(-1) soil. Our aim was to determine if significant quantities of P could be detected in the drainage water and their relationship to soil P concentrations. On five occasions between October 1992 and January 1994, both TP and DRP from plots receiving superphosphate frequently exceeded 1 mg L(-1) and were high compared with literature data. Ranging between 66 and 86% of TP, DRP was the largest fraction in drainage water. It remained low (<0.15 mg L(-1)) from plots below 60 mg Olsen-P kg(-1). There was then a rapid increase in DRP up to the maximum Olsen- P concentration. A simple linear Split-Line Model described this relationship very well for all drainage events. This implies that up to 60 mg Olsen-P kg(-1) soil (the change point), P was retained strongly in the plow layer. Above this, P losses in the drainage water were much more closely related to Olsen-P than commonly suggested. The mechanisms could either be preferential how or rapid transport of P in forms less susceptible to sorption but finally measured as DRP. The results suggest enhanced P losses through subsurface runoff on heavy soils, once a certain plow layer concentration of Olsen-P is exceeded.

VL 171
IS 2
PG 365-367
AB Carbon-13 abundance, expressed as delta(13)C in parts per thousand, was measured in wheat straw grown between 1984 and 1989 on the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted. In all six years, straw grown without fertilizer N contained less carbon-13 (i.e. delta(13)C was more negative) than straw grown with fertilizer, although the magnitude of this difference varied with year. In a dry year, when dry matter response to fertilizer N was relatively small, there was a large difference between the delta(13)C of straw grown with and without N. Conversely, in a wet year, when there was a marked response to N, there was little difference in the isotopic composition of N-fertilized and unfertilized straw. Over the six years, the difference between the delta(13)C value of straw grown with and without nitrogen ((DC)-C-13, in parts per thousand) was related to drought, measured as the calculated soil water deficit on 15 July (W-j, in mm), by the equation (DC)-C-13 = -0.299 + 0.01034 W-j (r = 0.87). Aerobic soils are an important sink for methane (CH4), contributing up to 15% of global CH4 destruction. However, the sink strength is significantly affected by land management, nitrogen (N) fertilizers and acidity. We tested these effects on samples taken from the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat, Park Grass permanent grassland and Broadbalk and Geescroft Wilderness Experiments at Rothamsted. The rates of uptake from the atmosphere of both enhanced (10 ppmv) and ambient (2 ppmv) concentrations of CH4 were measured in laboratory incubations of soil cores under controlled conditions. The most rapid rates of uptake were measured in soil from deciduous woodland at pH 7 (measured in water); acidic (pH 4) woodland soil showed no net CH4 oxidation. While disturbance of the cores used in the experiments did not affect the rate of CH4 uptake, extended (150 years) cultivation of land for arable crops reduced uptake rate by 85% compared to that in the soil under calcareous woodland. The long-term application of ammonium (NH4)-based fertilizer, but not nitrate (NO3)-based fertilizer, completely inhibited CH4 uptake, but the application for the same period of farmyard manure that contained more N than the fertilizer had no inhibitory effect. Autoclaving showed that the uptake of CH4 was microbially mediated. The most likely causes of the inhibitory effects seen are (i) insufficient concentrations of CH4 in, situ to activate methane monooxygenase; (ii) the direct inhibition of CH4 oxidation by NH4+ ions as the methanotrophs become adapted to oxidizing NH4+ ions; (iii) the suppression of methanotrophs by NH4-based fertilizers and acidity; (iv) the requirement of methanotrophs for a stable soil architecture which is incompatible with the disturbance caused by regular arable cultivation. These explanations are not mutually exclusive; several may operate concurrently.

SO European Journal of Soil Science
VL 46
IS 1
PG 139-146
AB Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained for solid samples of whole soils from three long-term field sites at Rothamsted Experimental Station, UK. In all sites, soil organic matter content was either increasing or decreasing due to contrasted long-continued treatments. Two soils were from Highfield, one from under old grassland (47 g organic C kg(-1)) and one from an area kept as bare fallow following ploughing of grass 21 years previously (14 g organic C kg(-1)). Three soils were taken from Broadbalk, two from plots within the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment which had received no fertilizer or animal manure annually for 148 years (7 and 27 g organic C kg(- 1), respectively) and one from Broadbalk Wilderness, wooded section (38 g organic C kg(-1)). Broadbalk Wilderness was arable until 1881 and has reverted to deciduous woodland in the subsequent 110 years. Two soils were from Geescroft, one from an arable field (9 g organic C kg(-1)) and one from Geescroft Wilderness (35 g organic C kg(-1)) which began reversion to deciduous woodland at the same time as Broadbalk Wilderness but is now acid (pH = 4.2) in contrast to Broadbalk which is calcareous (pH = 7.3). Solid-state C-13 NMR spectra were obtained on a 300-MHz instrument using cross polarization (CP) and magic angle spinning (MAS). All samples exhibited peaks in the following spectral regions: 0-45 ppm (alkyl), 45-60 ppm (methoxyl, carbohydrate and derivatives), 60-110 ppm (carbohydrates and derivatives, C-alpha of peptides), 110-160 ppm (aromatics) and 160-185 ppm (carboxyl groups and derivatives). Within the spectrum of a specific sample it was not possible to determine the relative proportions of soil organic carbon in the different forms identified because a range of factors can potentially alter the relative areas of peaks in different regions of the spectrum. However, from a comparison of relative peak areas within a set of soils from a given site, differing only in organic matter content, information can be deduced regarding the forms of C that are more or less subject to change in response to land use or management. At all sites carbohydrate C appears to be the form that is most subject to change, suggesting that it is an 'active' fraction compared with the other forms. It was greatest where organic matter inputs were greatest (due to inputs of farmyard manure or reversion to woodland) and declined relative to other forms following ploughing of old grassland. Alkyl C increased as total C accumulated but did not decline relative to other forms following ploughing of grass. One reason for the non-quantitative nature of the soil C-13 CPMAS spectra was a short (approximately 1 ms) component of the rotating-frame T-1 relaxation time for H nuclei (T-1 rho H). This problem was not overcome by acquiring data at -60 degrees C. In principle, solid-state spectra of soils obtained by direct polarization (i.e. without CP) might produce quantitative results, but the low C content of most mineral soils (10-50 g C kg(-1)) precludes this, given current instrumentation.

Examples are given of the effect on soils and crop yields of organic matter, the availability of P, and acidification. The use of archived material in addressing problems not even considered when the experiments began is also discussed. Long-term experiments are essential in determining the factors affecting soil fertility and sustainable production. In many cases, effects may only be observed or interactions become apparent over an extended time. Full use should be made of existing experiments and data; in particular, those on different soil types and under different climatic conditions should be compared so that the information is valuable to farmers, advisers, legislators, and other scientists in both the local and wider community.

TI Fertilization effects on organic matter in physically fractionated soils as studied by C-13 NMR: Results from two long-term field experiments
SO European Journal of Soil Science
VL 46
IS 4
PG 557-565
AB C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra taken using magic-angle spinning (MAS), cross polarization (CP) and with total suppression of side bands (TOSS) are reported for soils from two long-term field experiments. One set of soils was from the Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted, UK (monoculture of winter wheat since 1843) and the other was from the Lermarken site of the Askov Long-Term Experiment on Animal Manure and Mineral Fertilizers (arable rotation since 1894). At both sites soil samples were taken from three fertilizer treatments: nil, inorganic fertilizers, animal manure. Spectra were obtained from whole soil samples and from the size fractions clay (<2 mu m), silt (2-20 mu m) and, in some cases, sand (20-2000 mu m). Comparison of the total strengths of the C-13-NMR signal for each size separate in relation to its total organic C content shows that clay, particularly, contains large percentages of C not detected by NMR because of the large magnetic susceptibilities of the soil minerals. It is proposed that the bi observed signals come from the more labile pools of soil organic matter (SOM), on the presumption that these pools are less closely associated with soil minerals and iron oxides and are likely to be less protected from microbial or enzymic decomposition. For both Rothamsted and Askov, functional groups in the 45-110 ppm region (N- and O-alkyls) dominate in the spectra for whole soils, with aromatics (110-160 ppm) and alkyls (0-45 ppm) signals being the next prominent. In the Askov whole soil samples C-13-NMR revealed no differences between nil, inorganic fertilizer and animal manure treatments but in the Rothamsted whole soil there were some small differences. Clay and silt fractions from Askov contain more alkyls and less aromatics than those from Rothamsted. For both sites clay in enriched in alkyls and depleted in aromatics relative to silt. Clay from Askov, but not Rothamsted, contains more N-alkyls (45-65 ppm) and less acetals (90-110 ppm) than silt. O-alkyls (65-90 ppm) account for more than 20% of the total signal in clay and silt from both sites. Fertilization regimes have not significantly affected the chemical composition of SOM associated with clay- and silt-sized fractions in the soils at either site. We conclude that the chemical composition of SOM is determined primarily by the interaction between the organisms responsible for decomposition and the mineral soil matrix rather than the nature of substrate input.

TI Tillage and Crop Residue Management Effects on Losses of Chemicals from Soils
SO Soil & Tillage Research
VL 30
IS 2-4
PG 125-168
AB Tillage and crop residue management both influence the losses of nutrients and crop-protection chemicals from the soil to the aqueous environment. Tillage is performed to control weeds, to modify the soil structure and often to incorporate straw, which can no longer be burnt in European Community countries. The resulting changes in the soil alter both the pathways for water flow and the activities of microbes. This paper reviews their effects on water movement and the microbial and physico-chemical processes that influence the vulnerabilities of nutrients and crop-protection chemicals to leaching. It also suggests some possible options for limiting losses of these substances from the soil. There remains considerable scope for cooperation between tillage specialists and those with an interest in the management of nutrients and crop-protection chemicals.

SO Soil Biology & Biochemistry
VL 26

PG 1613-1622
AB Net uptake of CH4 was measured in intact soil cores (6.4 cm dia, 12 cm deep) collected from an arable wheat field, from three sites left uncultivated for more than 110 years following arable cropping and from a permanent grassland with different mineral N treatments subdivided into four pH levels. Soil cores were incubated in sealed 1 litre jars at 250 degrees C for 48 h with a CH4-amended atmosphere of 10 mu l 1(-1) at the start of incubation. The decrease in CH4 concentration followed first- order-kinetics and by log-transformation individual uptake rates could be calculated for each treatment. Soil from a calcareous site (PH 7.4) under deciduous woodland (Broadbalk Wilderness wooded section) oxidized CH4 6 times faster than the arable plot (pH 7.8) with the highest activity in the adjacent Broadbalk Wheat Experiment (with uptake rates of - 80 and - 13 nl CH4 1(-1) h(-1), respectively). The CH4 uptake rate was only 20% of that in the woodland in an adjacent area that had been uncultivated for the same period but kept as rough grassland by the annual removal of trees and shrubs and, since 1960, grazed during the summer by sheep. It is suggested that the continuous input of urea through animal excreta was mainly responsible for this difference. Another undisturbed woodland area with an acidic soil reaction (pH 4.1) did not oxidize any CH4. On a permanent grassland site (Park Grass Continuous Hay Experiment), the plot without N fertilization showed a distinct pH effect: CH4 consumption decreased from -67 to -35 nl CH4 1(- 1) h(-1) with decreasing pH in the range 6.3-5.6 and declined to zero between pH 5.6 and 5.1. Mineral N applied annually as (NH4)(2)SO4, at either 96 or 144 kg N ha(-1) for 130 years, completely inhibited CH4 oxidation, even where lime was applied to maintain a soil pH of about 6. By contrast, the long-term application of N as NaNO3 (96 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)) caused no decline in CH4 oxidation compared to unfertilized grassland at the same pH and, in some cases, caused a small increase. Withholding NH4-N for 3 years caused no significant recovery of CH4-oxidizing activity; withholding NO3-N caused a slight decline. Thus, land use (arable, cut grassland, grazed grassland or woodland), soil pH, N fertilizer inputs and form of N (NH4 or NO3) all have marked and interacting effects on the extent to which aerobic soil acts as a sink for CH4. The mechanisms through which the factors operate are not known but some possibilities are discussed. The results have important implications for the planning of land use and agricultural practices that will maximize the extent to which aerobic soils can act as a sink for CH4.

SO International Journal of Remote Sensing
VL 15
IS 3
PG 705-709
AB The concentration of chlorophyll in a crop can be related to both the position of the red edge in a reflectance spectrum and the yield of that crop. The use of a remotely-sensed red edge to estimate yield is dependent upon a well-understood relationship between chlorophyll concentration and yield and a poorly understood relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration. To determine the form of the relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration a field experiment was undertaken using a wheat crop with an exceptionally large range of chlorophyll concentrations. The non-linear form of the relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration meant that estimates of red edge could be used to estimate chlorophyll concentration up to 0.5 mg g-1 and thereby yield up to 6t ha-1.

TI Old and modern wheat cultivars compared on the Broadbalk wheat experiment
SO European Journal of Agronomy

IS 2
PG 141-147
AB Productivity and N concentration of wheat cv. Brimstone (modern) and Square Head's Master (old) were compared in field experiments at Rothamsted Experimental Station, UK in 1988-90. The cultivars were supplied with 0-288 kg N/ha and basal dressings of P, K and Mg (except for one plot). Brimstone had a 52% higher grain yield than Square Head's Master. Both absolutely and proportionately, Brimstone produced more grain at the higher levels of N application than did Square Head's Master. Lodging did not appear to reduce the yield of Square Head's Master. N application greatly increased shoot biomass at maturity, but at any given level of N application, the biomass of the 2 cultivars was virtually identical. Because of the greater harvest index of Brimstone, and despite the lower N concentration in its grain, its grain from unit land area contained more N than did that of Square Head's Master. Accordingly, the apparent recovery of N by the grain of Brimstone was greater than that of Square Head's Master. It was calculated that less land and fertilizer N would be needed to produce a tonne of grain with Brimstone than with Square Head's Master. However, the apparent loss of fertilizer N in intensive wheat growing was estimated to be greater at high than at low levels of application, whether or not straw was incorporated into the soil.

AB In 1993, Rothamsted Experimental Station, the oldest agricultural research institute in the world, celebrated 150 years of experimental work on the production of farm crops. Most of the station's 'classical experiments', begun by its founder John (later Sir John) Lawes between 1843 and 1856, continue today and provide useful information for contemporary agriculture and ecology which Lawes could never have envisaged. These include development of a model for the turnover of organic matter in soil, assessments of the increasing pollution of soil by toxic metals and organic carcinogens resulting from twentieth century industrial activities, and insights into the ecological consequences of changes in agricultural policies. The experiments also provide many examples of the value of long term, systematic data collection and interdisciplinary research in agricultural production, ecology and environmental pollution. Facilities for this work became available through the scientific flair and foresight of Lawes, and since his death have been maintained and extended by generations of dedicated scientists.

AB The changing populations of weeds during 13 years of the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiment were analysed to investigate the extent of differences in short-term variability of cover between species. Data were from two sections of the experiment where winter wheat was grown continuously under herbicide treatment for 13 and six years respectively. Equisetum arvense showed significant long-term increases on both sections; long-term trends were also detected in the longer data run for Agrostis stolonifera, Cirsium arvensa, Poa trivialis, Ranunculus arvensis and Vicia sativa, and for Medicago lupulina on the shorter data run. Variation around long-term trends was low in the case of Equisetum, and, in the longer data run, for Cirsium and Tussilago farfara, and high for Poa spp. and Vicia. Cover values on the two sections were positively correlated for Alopecurus myosuroides, Equisetum, Poa annua and Tripleurospermum inodorum. There was a weak correlation between C-S-R strategy and short-term variability; the more competitive species displayed less variability than the ruderal species. Species regenerating from persistent seed banks were more variable in the short term than those regenerating from short-lived seed or bud banks. This can be explained by differences in response to year-to-year variation in environmental conditions, those species with persistent seed banks being typically more sensitive to annual fluctuations in the environment than those without. -Author

AB The effect of autoclaving and of long- and short-term N fertilization on methane oxidation was studied in soil samples from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, Rothamsted, UK. Soil cores were incubated in sealed jars. It was shown that: (1) the disappearance of methane in the jars was entirely mediated by microbial activity; (2)long-term (140 years) application of mineral N fertilizer resulted in significant differences in the ability of the soil to oxidize methane; the higher the amount of fertilizer applied the lower the rate of methane oxidation; (3) applications of 48-288 kg mineral N/ha as ammonium or nitrate showed no significant effect on the methane oxidizing ability; and (4) the annual application of 240 kg N/ha as FYM had almost the same ability to oxidize methane as the zero-N treatment.

AB Methane uptake by a temperate arable soil was investigated in incubation experiments with intact soil cores. The measurements were carried out with a soil moisture content of 16-17% (w/w) and at 25 deg C. The decrease of the CH4 concn in an amended atmosphere (10 mu litre CH4/litre) was measured during a 212 h period. There was no decrease of CH4 if the soil was autoclaved showing that the disappearance of methane was entirely mediated by microbial activity. The long-term application (140 yr) of mineral nitrogen fertilizer caused significant differences in the ability of the soil to oxidize CH4: the larger the amount of fertilizer applied the lower rate of CH4 oxidation. No significant short-term effect of mineral-N fertilization could be observed whether applied as (NH4)SO4 or KNO3. An organic manure treatment, which has received nearly 240 kg N/ha each year as farmyard manure, showed almost the same ability to oxidize CH4 as an unfertilized plot and had a significantly higher CH4 oxidation rate after an application of 144 kg N/ha as nitrate fertilizer. For the mineral-N treatments the inhibition of the CH4 oxidation increased with increasing N turnover rate but was independent of the mineral nitrogen content of the soil at the time of measurement. Therefore, the continued application of mineral-N fertilizer for an extended period (at least 7 yr) caused a depletion of the bacterial methane sink in soil and may have contributed to the continuous increase in atmospheric CH4 over the past decades.

TI The Course of N-15-Ammonium Nitrate in a Spring Barley Cropping System. Short-Term Variability of Plant-Populations within a Regularly Disturbed Habitat
SO Plant and Soil
VL 150
IS 2
PG 167-175
AB N-15-labelled ammonium nitrate was applied to spring barley growing on a Cambisol soil in western Switzerland. Immobilization, plant uptake and disappearance of inorganic nitrogen were followed at frequent intervals. Fertilizer nitrogen disappeared shortly after its application, mainly through immobilization by soil microorganisms and absorption by the crop. Some of the added nitrogen was probably denitrified as a result of humid conditions during the first days after fertilizer application. At the end of the growing season, 31% of the added nitrogen was recovered from the aerial barley plants. and 56% was immobilized by microorganisms. Most of the fertilizer nitrogen not used by the crop was immobilized in the upper 0-30 cm soil layer. This prevented downward movement of nitrate and limited nitrogen losses. Fertilizer efficiency was mainly determined by the competition between crop uptake and microbial immobilization. Careful consideration of the time of fertilization, taking into account plant growth and weather conditions, can result in an increase in fertilizer efficiency and minimal pollution. The changing populations of weeds during 13 years of the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiment were analysed to investigate the extent of differences in short-term variability of cover between species. The data were from two sections of the experiment where winter wheat was grown continuously under herbicide treatment for 13 and 6 years respectively. Logistic regressions were fitted to the data. Equisetum arvense showed significant long-term increases on both sections; long-term trends were also detected in the longer data run for Agrostis stolonifera, Cirsium arvensa, Poa trivialis, Ranunculus arvensis and Vicia sativa, and for Medicago lupulina on the shorter data run. Variation around long-term trends was low in the case of Equisetum, and, in the longer data run, for Cirsium and Tussilago farfara, and high for Poa spp. and Vicia.

There was a weak correlation between C-S-R strategy and short-term variability; the more competitive species displayed less variability than the ruderal species. Furthermore, species regenerating from persistent seed banks were more variable in the short term than those regenerating from short-lived seed or bud banks. This can be explained by differences in response to year-to-year variation in environmental conditions, those species with:persistent seed banks being typically more sensitive to annual fluctuations in the environment than those without.

TI Partitioning Losses of Nitrogen-Fertilizer between Leaching and Denitrification
SO Journal of Agricultural Science
VL 118
PG 101-107
AB When N-15 is used to trace the fate of N fertilizer applied in spring to winter wheat crops, some is not recovered in the crop or the soil and has to be presumed lost. In 13 experiments made from 1980 to 1983 on three widely differing soils, these losses ranged from 1 to 35%. We partitioned them between leaching and denitrification by using models to estimate the loss by leaching, taking into account the N absorbed by the crops, and subtracting this loss from the total loss to obtain the apparent percentage loss by denitrification, L(DN). An analysis of variance showed that L(DN) increased significantly with the quantity of N applied, so the study considered L(DN) values for a standard N application of 150 kg ha subsequently. Regressions showed that L(DN) was better related to the wetness of the soil during the 3 weeks after fertilizer application than to the corresponding amount of rain, as would be expected for denitrification. Values of L(DN) could not, however, be satisfactorily related to soil temperature, probably because the range of temperatures was too narrow. The apparent losses by denitrification were, on average, nearly twice as large as those by leaching, but the ratio varied greatly between experiments.

TI Calculating net primary production and annual input of organic matter to soil from the amount and radiocarbon content of soil organic matter
SO Soil Biology & Biochemistry
VL 24
IS 4
PG 295-308
AB Soil samples collected from four of the Rothamsted long-term field experiments over the last 100 yr were used to follow the effects of management on soil organic matter content. The experimental sites were: Broadbalk and Geescroft Wildernesses, both on old arable land that had been fenced off in the early 1880s and allowed to revert naturally to deciduous woodland; the unmanured plot in the Rothamstead Park Grass continuous Hay Experiment, started in 1856; the unmanured and one of the NPK plots in the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment started in 1843. Total C, radiocarbon and (in some cases) soil microbial biomass C were measured in stored and contemporary soil samples. The current Rothamsted model for the turnover of organic C in soil was then used to calculate how the organic C content of the topsoils from the four sites would change with time for a range of annual inputs. The inputs that generated the best fit to the measured values were: Broadbalk Wilderness 3.5 t C/ha per yr, Geescroft Wilderness 2.5 t C/ha per yr; unmanured plot on Park Grass 3.0 t C/ha per yr; unmanured plot on Broadbalk Wheat 1.3 t C/ha per yr; NPK plot on Broadbalk Wheat 1.7 t C/ha per yr. The quantities of soil microbial biomass (measured by fumigation-incubation) in the top 23 cm of soil from the four sites were: Broadbalk Wilderness, 1.57 t C/ha; Geescroft Wilderness, 0.58 t C/ha; unmanured plot on Park Grass, 1.62 t C/ha, unmanured plot on Broadbalk Wheat, 0.47 t C/ha; NPK plot on Broadbalk Wheat, 0.76 t C/ha. The values for soil microbial C generated by the model for the above annual inputs agreed closely (with one exception) with the measured values. For a site under steady-state conditions, the annual input of organic matter to the soil plus the annual removal of organic matter from the site (if any) gives the Net Primary Production (NPP). NPP thus calculated was 4.0 t C/ha per yr for the unmanured plot on Park Grass, 2.2 for the unmanured plot on Broadbalk and 5.2 for the NPK plot on Broadbalk. The two Wilderness sites are still accumulating C in both soil and vegetation and here NPP is given by annual input to the soil, plus the annual increment of C in the trees. NPP calculated in this way was 4.8 t C/ha per yr for Broadbalk Wilderness and 3.3 for Geescroft Wilderness.

AB The Rothamsted long-term experiments - the Classicals - were started almost 150 yr ago. These experiments were originally designed to study the N, P, K, Na, Mg, and Si needs of the field crops then grown in England. This was done by comparing these inorganic nutrients, in various combinations, with farmyard manure, the traditional source of fertility at that time. Although the questions the experiments were originally designed to answer have long been resolved, the experiments continue to give results of interest to agronomists, ecologists, soil scientists, plant pathologists, and others. The experiments show that grain yields can be sustained (and even increased) for almost 150 years in monocultures of wheat and barley given organic or inorganic fertilizer annually. They provide data on the long-term effects of inorganic fertilizers and organic manures on soil or organic matter levels. These data have been used to test computer-based models for the turnover of organic matter in soil. Again, long-term N balances show that there are considerable inputs of N to the soil/plant system, amounting to some 30 kg N/ha annually in unfertilized wheat and up to 65 kg/ha annually in an arable soil reverting to woodland. These and other results are used to consider the advantages and disadvantages of long-term experiments. Wisely used, long-term experimental sites provide information on the long-term sustainability of agricultural systems that can be obtained in no other way.

AB Notes the preponderance of short-term experiments in ecology, and identifies some of the ways results from such work are of limited value, both generally and in agro-ecology. Long-term studies are critical for evaluating slow ecosystem processes, rare events, cyclical phenomenal processes with a high variability, complex phenomena, transient dynamics, testing ecological theory, providing experimental arenas and considering the temporal dimension. Problems (scientific, political, personal) in establishing long-term experiments and observation are highlighted. Three examples of long-term and synoptic studies are drawn from the work at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire; the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiment, instigated in 1843; the Park Grass experiment, laid down in 1856; and the Rothamsted Insect Survey, which began in the early 1960s.

TI 130 years of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer applications to the Broadbalk wheat experiment: the effect on soil organic nitrogen
SO Transactions 14th International Congress of Soil Science, August 1990, Volume IV Kyoto, Japan
PG 9-13
AB The larger crops grown when inorganic N fertilizer is applied return more organic N to the soil as crop residues (roots, root exudates, stubble, etc.). These additional inputs are small but cumulative, and in the long term the continuous use of fertilizer N may indirectly increase the total organic N content of the soil, and thus N mineralization. The Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted provides an opportunity to investigate these effects, as it includes plots given the same rates of inorganic N fertilizer each year since 1852 (0, 48, 96 or 144 kg N ha-<sup>1 yr-<sup>1, referred to as the N0, N1, N2 and N3 treatments). Winter wheat is grown each year and the straw removed. The N4 treatment has received 192 kg N ha-<sup>1 yr-<sup>1 since 1968; previously it received the N1 treatment. The application of 35 t ha-<sup>1 of farmyard manure each year since 1843 has more than doubled soil organic N content, and lead to an even greater increase in mineralizable N. In contrast, long term applications of inorganic N have had a much smaller effect on total soil N - at most an increase of 20%, or 0.5 t N ha-<sup>1 (0-23 cm) after 130 years of applying 144 kg N ha-<sup>1. However, the effect on N mineralization appears to be much greater. Depending on the method of estimation, soil from the N3 treatment appears to mineralize at least 60% more N than soil never given fertilizer N, with an increase in crop uptake of mineralized N of as much as 30 kg N ha-<sup>1. This suggests that the small amount of additional organic N returned to the soil as a result of using inorganic N is in a fraction that turns over more rapidly than the N in the older organic matter. Soil under the N4 treatment, started only 20 years ago, contains less total N than the N3 treatment, but an equal or greater amount of mineralizable N, suggesting that changes in mineralizable N occur more quickly than changes in total N. An increase in N mineralization that benefits subsequent crops may also increase the risk of nitrate leaching, with the consequent pollution of aquifers.

SO Soil Biology & Biochemistry
VL 22
IS 8
PG 1023-1027
AB Amato and Ladd showed that the amount of ninhydrin-reactive nitrogen (ninhydrin-N) extracted from soil by 2 m KCl following chcl3 fumigation is a reliable and sensitive indicator of the amount of soil microbial biomass. However, when we attempted the assay in 0.5 m k2so4 soil extracts, serious analytical problems (e.g. precipitation of CaSO4 and K2SO4) occurred, which invalidated the ninhydrin-N determinations. As measurement of biomass C (and probably biomass N) in soils by fumigation-extraction is more reliable when K2SO4, rather than KCl, is used as the extractant, we modified the ninhydrin-N assay procedure to permit measurements in 0.5 m K2SO4. Our modified procedure is described. A strong relationship (r = 0.99) between ninhydrin-N measured in KCl and K2SO4 soil extracts was obtained (KCl-ninhydrin-N = 0.90 K2SO4-ninhydrin-N). There were also strong linear relationships (r = 0.91?95) between biomass C, biomass N and biomass ninhydrin-N (all extracted with 0.5 M K2SO4). We conclude that reliable ninhydrin-N measurements are obtained in 0.5 m K2SO4 soil extracts by our modified procedure.

AB In several plots of the Broadbalk (Hertfordshire) continuous wheat Triticum aestivum experiments total soil N content has remained constant for at least 100 yr so that annual inputs of N are balanced by annual outputs. Between 1980-1983 15N-labelled fertiliser was applied to microplots within certain plots. For the plot receiving (nominally) 144 kg N ha-1 as fertiliser annually, 79% of the fertiliser N was retained in the crop:soil system and the average annual removal of N in grain and straw was 140 kg ha-1. Total annual loss of N was calculated as 54 kg ha-1 and, in order to maintain steady state conditions, it was necessary to postulate an annual input of 48 kg N ha-1 from non-fertiliser sources. This input was similar for fertiliser N rates between 0-192 kg ha-1. Values for loss and non-fertiliser input are conservative. Part of the non-fertiliser input will be in rain (currently 10<>0n15 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and seed (4 kg N ha-1 yr-1). There will be contributions from dry deposition of NH3, NOx and HNO3 onto soil and foliage. Although biological fixation of atmospheric N2 by heterotrophic bacteria does not appear to be important, fixation by photosynthetic cyanobacteria may contribute significantly. -from Authors

SO Acid deposition: sources, effects and controls. (Longhurst J.W.S. (ed) - Technical Communications; Letchworth, Herts; UK )
PG 213-228
AB Analyses of precipitation at Rothamsted began in 1853 and have continued periodically. Soil and plant samples have been taken at intervals from the permanent grassland of the Park Grass Experiment (begun in 1856) and from the deciduous woodland of the Broadbalk and Geescroft Wilderness Experiments (begun in the 1880s). By combining precipitation chemistry with minimum estimates of other inputs, the relative importance of atmospheric deposition to acid inputs can be estimated, as well as the effect of these on the composition and yield of grassland and woodland in these particular soils. Acid rain (wet deposited H+) has been a negligible source of acidity throughout the experiments. Total atmospheric deposition, including dry deposited SO2 and NOx, and NH4 total acidifying inputs when soils are at or near pH 7 and up to 70% in more acid soil. Acidification slightly reduces the yield of herbage and the number of species present in grassland and the stand weight of woodland; different tree species dominate acid woodland soils. There has been greater acidification under deciduous woodland than grassland which is not grazed. This has important implications for the possible move of land from agriculture into forestry or agroforestry.

PG 535-541
AB A simple four-compartment model is presented for the turnover of N through the soil microbial biomass, based on measurements made in the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment. The model comprises an input compartment (containing the N in roots and other plant debris entering the soil plus the inorganic N immobilized during the decomposition of this debris), feeding the microbial biomass compartment and the humus compartment, which in turn feed the soil inorganic N compartment. The model was fitted to data from the plot receiving 192 kg N ha-1 yr-1 by iterative adjustment of the five independent parameters it contains. The value for the turnover time of N in the soil microbial biomass is 1.52 yr, the corresponding annual flux through the biomass being 125 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Of this flux, 59 kg comes from the input compartment and 66 kg from the humus compartment.

AB A single pulse of 15N-labelled fertilizer was applied in spring as NH4 NO3 to each of four plots on the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment. Wheat has been grown on this experiment for more than 140 yr. The labelled N was applied at 48, 96, 144 and 192 kg N ha-1 yr-1 for the four plots. In subsequent years the plots reverted to unlabelled N, again given at these rates. Soils receiving inorganic fertilizer contained more biomass than soil from the plot that has never received inorganic N, but there was litter difference in the microbial biomass N content of soils that had had 48, 96, 144 or 192 kg N ha-1 for many years. There were no consistent changes during a 4-yr period in total microbial biomass N. Of the labelled fertilizer applied, 3-8% was present in the soil microbial biomass at the first harvest after application of labelled fertilizer. Of the total labelled N remaining in the soil at the first harvest, 19-27% was present in the microbial biomass. In the plot receiving 192 kg N ha-1 yr-1, labelled biomass N declined from 5.69 kg ha-1 at the first harvest, to 4.50 at the second, to 3.35 at the third and to 2.35 at the fourth. In a subsidiary experiment, more N was retained in the soil at harvest when the fertilizer was added in the ammonium form than as nitrate; 32.6 and 19.5 kg ha-1, respectively, for additions of 147 kg fertilizer N ha-1. However, of the labelled N retained in the soil, 34% was present in the microbial biomass, whether the labelled N had originally been added in the ammonium form or in the nitrate form.

AB Soil and plant samples have been taken at intervals from the permanent grassland of the Park Grass Experiment (begun in 1856) and from the deciduous woodland of the Broadbalk and Geescroft Wilderness Experiments (begun in the 1880's). The relative importance of atmospheric deposition to acid inputs and the effects of acid inputs on the composition and yield of grassland and woodland have been evaluated from a combination of precipitation chemistry and estimates of other inputs. Acid rain has been a negligible source of acidity throughout the 100 year period of the experiments. Total atmospheric deposition (including dry deposited SO2 and NOx) and NH4+ which may be nitrified, comprised up to 30% of the total acidifying inputs when soils were at or near pH 7 and up to 70% in more acid soils. Acidification slightly reduced the yield of herbage and the number of species present in grassland and the stand wt of woodland. Different tree species dominated acid woodland soils. There has been a greater acidification under deciduous woodland than under ungrazed grassland. The implications of a move in land use from agriculture to forestry or agroforestry are discussed.

AB 15N-labelled nitrogen fertilizer (containing equal quantities of ammonium-N and nitrate-N) was applied in 4 consecutive years (1980-3) to different microplots located within the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted, an experiment which has carried winter wheat continuously since 1843. Plots receiving 48, 96, 144 and 192 kg N/ha every year were given labelled fertilizer in mid-April at (nominally) these rates. Measurements taken allow a quantitative description of nitrogen cycling in the plough layer (0-23 cm) to be given.

TI Cadmium accumulation in soils from long-continued applications of superphosphate
SO Journal of Soil Science
VL 37
IS 1
PG 99-107
AB A simple, sensitive method developed for the analysis of geostandards was used to measure the accumulation of Cd in soils from superphosphate applied annually to grassland and arable soils for many years. Rates of application were equivalent to 33 kg P and 5 g Cd ha-1 yr-1 for 95 yr in three experiments in England and to 37 kg P and 20 g Cd ha-1 yr-1 for 30 yr in one experiment in New Zealand. Very little Cd accumulated in the surface horizons (0-22.5 cm) of either of the arable soils from England; about one-quarter of the applied Cd was detected in the sub-soil (22.5-45.0 cm) of one experiment (Broadbalk) but none in the second (Barnfield). About one-half of the applied Cd was retained in the 0-22.5 cm horizon of grassland soils from both England and New Zealand. The light (< 2.2 g cm-3) organic-rich fraction of Park Grass soil from England contained about three times as much Cd as the heavier, mineral-rich fraction. This suggests that when Cd is incorporated into organic matter its mobility is decreased and soil pH then has smaller effects on its mobility. Uptake of Cd by grass-clover pasture in New Zealand averaged only 0.4 g Cd ha-1 yr-1 or 2% of the amount applied.

AB The standard and differential thermodynamic properties of K-Ca exchange in soils from the Broadbalk (Batcombe series) and Saxmundham Rotation I (Beccles series) Experiments were evaluated for selected manurial treatments, using exchange isotherms and calorimetric measurements. It is suggested that the differences are caused by the different pH values of the surface soils before they came into arable usage, which reflect their contrasting parent materials and pedogenic histories, and by the different durations and extents of manuring in the two experiments. -from Authors

SO Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture
VL 34
PG 335-344
AB Weighted-mean L-values and uptakes of P by plants were determined using ryegrass grown in a controlled environment on soils obtained from long-term field experiments at Rothamsted (Batcombe and Winchester soil series), Woburn (Stackyard and Cottenham series) and Saxmundham (Beccles series) given different organic and inorganic manurial treatments. Linear regression analysis showed that, under the experimental conditions used, (small soil volume, weekly additions of all nutrients other than P) initial soil NaHCO3-soluble P accounted for more than 95% of the variance of plant-P uptake and weighted-mean L-values. The relationships between NaHCO3-soluble P, plant-P uptakes and weighted-mean L-values (labile P) were all independent of soil type and form of P fertiliser applied. In most soils, L-values increased with increasing cut number, and the rate of increase was linearly related to initial soil NaHCO3-soluble P, suggesting that NaHCO3-P measurements may provide information on the availability of initially non-isotopically exchangeable soil-P reserves. The plants removed about 68% more P from the soils than was measured as initially NaHCO3-soluble and about one-half of the labile soil-P. Labile soil-P was 3.5 times greater than initial NaHCO3-soluble P. The initial soil NaHCO3-soluble P required to provide at least 95% of maximum yield increased with increasing cut number (from 37 mg P kg-1 soil at cut 1 to 160 mg P kg-1 soil at cut 4), probably because the NaHCO3-P pool was replenished more slowly than P was removoed by the plants.

TI The Broadbalk wheat experiment 1968-78: yields and plant nutrients in crops grown continuously and in rotation, 
SO Rothamsted Experimental Station Report for 1982,
VL Part 2
IS 5-44
AB Modifications made to the Broadbalk wheat experiment in 1968 included growing wheat in rotations of potatoes/beans [Vicia faba]/wheat and fallow/wheat/wheat. The major change in manuring was to apply all N in spring as Nitro-Chalk and introduce a test of 192 kg N/ha. Av. yields for all crops and all treatments during 1970-8 are given. Wheat yields were higher than at any time since 1843, even on soils unmanured since then. Wheat after beans gave the highest grain yield. Potatoes and wheat responded differently to unbalanced manuring. N response curves were fitted to the 1970-8 av. yields of wheat grown continuously, as 1st and 2nd crops after fallow and following beans. The curves for the 3 rotational wheats were brought into coincidence with that for continuous wheat by vertical and horizontal shifts. Relative to wheat grown continuously, the vertical shifts were equivalent to increased yields for wheat after beans (0.51 t/ha) and 2nd wheat after fallow (0.38 t/ha), but decreased yield for 1st wheat after fallow (-0.36 t/ha). The horizontal shifts were equivalent to increases in available N for wheat after beans (23 kg/ha) and 1st wheat after fallow (53 kg/ha), but a slight decrease for 2nd wheat after fallow (-9 kg/ha). N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Na contents in all the crops averaged over 1970-5 (1978 for N) and offtakes of these nutrients in the harvested crops are given. Wheat grain after beans and from continuous wheat contained, on av. 1.94 and 1.92% N in the DM, resp. Of the total offtake by wheat in grain plus straw the proportion in the grain was 82% for N, 85% for P, 44% for K, 16% for Ca, 71% for Mg and 40% for Na. Compared with earlier periods, grain N content had changed little but N offtakes were larger, because yield had increased, and apparent recoveries of fertilizer N had improved. Grain P content had decreased by c. 25% but offtakes were larger, again because yield had increased. There was little or no change in K content but there were large seasonal differences in straw K content. Ca, Mg and Na conc. in grain and straw had changed very little.

The quantity of exchangeable K measured by each method, except that by Ca-resin, gave significant correlations with the K balance of the soils, and yield and or K offtake of winter wheat grown on the plots. The new HCl-reflux method gave the closest correlations. -from Authors Potassium release Soil analysis.

AB Most of the land in the Middle Ages, because it was heavy, was chronically dirty and this was a major reason for the low crop yields. The Broadbalk Field at Rothamsted demonstrates that yields on loams and heavy soils can be maintained at a higher figure than in medieval times without fertilizers and the complete rest every third year that the three-field rotation allowed for. But with their puny and illfed animals and inefficient implements, the impossibility of cross ploughing, and the absence of effective drainage, the land must generally have been in such a state of weediness that it is not surprising that the peasants and even their lords had to be content with yields so low that they make history.-Author

AB The total soil N in Broadbalk continuous wheat plots receiving inorganic fertilizers has changed little since 1865 but has increased in plots receiving FYM. The amount of N received in rainfall from Arpil 1969 to March 1970 was 8.6 kg/ha, compared with an av. of 5.4 kg annually for 1960-4 and 4.4 kg for 1889-1903; that contributed in sown seed was 2-4 kg/ha and up to 13.3 kg could be fixed by soil from dry deposition of atmospheric NH3. N uptake was very similar in 1966-7 using cv. Squarehead's Master to that in 1852-61 using cv. Red Rastock; replacement of Squarehead's Master by cv. Cappelle-Desprez in 1970-2 resulted in a large increase in yield and N uptake. As N application increased from 0 to 144 kg/ha, there was a change from a net annual N gain from the atmosphere to a net annual loss.

AB Quantitative studies at Rothamsted on the effects of fertilizers on the occurrence of VA mycorrhiza and Endogone spp. spores under agricultural conditions are summarized. On Broadbalk wheat plots the mycorrhizal population was much larger on plots which had not received fertilizer since 1843 and several Endogone spore types were present. Numbers of white reticulate spores were most affected by fertilizer. On Little Knott wheat plots, N treatment reduced VA infection and spore numbers. All spores were of the laminate type. On a light sandy soil at Woburn, where wheat was grown in rotation with potatoes and legumes, mainly spores of the reticulate type were found and their numbers were greatly reduced by N fertilizer. In Vicia faba, N had no clear effect on spore numbers. In a rotation of potatoes, barley and swedes, most VA infection was present in plots given least P and most spores occurred in plots given intermediate amounts of P. The results are compared with those of other field and glasshouse experiments.

For both electrodes a 1:0.5 soil:water ratio and a 30 sec equilibration time were satisfactory. Changes in NO3 and K concentrations in the Broadbalk soil were related more to the amounts of individual nutrients added in different treatments than to the N:K ratio in each fertilizer treatment.
