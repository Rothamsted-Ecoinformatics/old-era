<h1>Release Note 15th May 2013</h1>
<h1><br />
  The <em>electronic</em>-Rothamsted  Archive (e-RA) Data Extraction Tool<br />
  Version 2.1</h1>
<h2>We have launched an improved version of e-RA&rsquo;s <strong>Data  Extraction Tool (DET)</strong><br />
  &nbsp;<br />
In this  version:</h2>
<p><strong>Improved interface</strong>: we have responded to feedback from  Rothamsted users and international colleagues to assess ease of use and improve  the existing interface. <br />
  <strong>Improved help pages</strong> (&lsquo;Getting Started&rsquo; tab): both the existing  contextual help tags and the help guide have been improved to reflect the  changes in the interface and to be easier to use.<br />
  <strong>Improved Registration form</strong> (from the Log in/Log out Tab): the links to  register are now preformatted to include the necessary  information and simplify the  process.<br />
  <strong>DET now available to users outside  Rothamsted: </strong>after  testing within Rothamsted the DET is available to other scientists in the UK and abroad. </p>
<p>The database currently contains data from 1844  onwards relating to:<br />
  <br />
  <strong>The Classical Experiments</strong><br />
  Broadbalk (from 1844), Park Grass&nbsp; (from 1856), Hoosfield Barley (from  1852), Alternate Wheat &amp; Fallow (from 1856). Data includes&nbsp; crop  yields, crop nutrient data, disease scores, weed surveys, Park Grass&nbsp;  species composition data, soil data and background information such as  cropping, treatments and experiment plans. For a complete listing see <a href="http://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/index.php?area=home&amp;page=det">All  datasets</a>.<br />
  <strong>Meteorological&nbsp;data <br />
</strong>Daily records for Rothamsted (from 1853), Brooms Barn (from 1982) and Woburn  (from 1928)</p>
<p>The database remains password protected and  passwords are available from the e-RA curators by using the User Registration  link on the Log in/Log out page. </p>
<p>To access the new database:</p>
<p>This new version is accessible via the &lsquo;Extract  Data&rsquo; tab on the e-RA website <a href="http://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/">www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk</a>. The website contains accompanying plans  and associated information plus a comprehensive searchable bibliography of  publications relating to the long-term experiments.</p>
<p>Other information:</p>
<p>For complicated data requirements, the e-RA  curators can provide a tailor-made query. The metadata to describe this set of  experiments, samples and data is complex, and management practices have changed  over the 170 year duration meaning the extraction of appropriate data can be  challenging. </p>
<p>This Release is part of our commitment to the <strong>Long Term Experiments National Capability  Grant</strong> to make our data more visible and accessible to the research  community. </p>
<p>Content of the database is steadily increasing and the  release of new datasets and other relevant pieces of news can be followed on  Twitter <strong>@eRA_Curator</strong>. </p>
