<p align="justify"><strong>Mean long-term winter wheat yields</strong> from selected treatments   on Broadbalk are shown. The changes reflect the improved cultivars, 
cultivations and   control of pests, diseases and weeds that have been introduced on Broadbalk,   especially since the 1960s. Yields of continuous   
wheat given no fertilizer or manure have remained at around 1 t ha <sup>-1</sup>.   Since 1979 summer fungicides have been used, which has allowed us to exploit the   greater grain 
yield potential of modern cultivars. In 1968 a rotation was   introduced on part of the experiment, so that it is now possible to compare the   yields of wheat grown 
continuously and as the first wheat after a two year   break. The highest yields are now from the first wheat crop in rotation, with   the best yields from fertilizer alone exceeding those from FYM alone, and the   
combination of FYM + 96 kgN ha<sup>-1</sup> (144 kgN ha<sup>-1</sup> since 2005)   often exceeding both.</p>

The larger Olsen P concentrations on plot 5 (PKMg) compared to plot 8 (N3PKMg), despite their similar P inputs, were a result of the higher yields and greater P offtakes in the crop on plot 8, due to the applied N. The relatively low Olsen P concentrations on plot 18 (N2 1/2PKMg) were a result of the limited P inputs between 1844 and 2001. Olsen P concentrations were least on plots receiving no (or very little) P inputs in fertilizer (plot 3, given no fertilizer or manure). </p>

<h2>Broadbalk & Geescroft Wilderness Experiments:</h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>The accumulation of organic carbon in soil and tree biomass</strong> has been measured on two contrasting sites at Rothamsted that were fenced off in the 1880s and allowed to revert 
naturally to woodland. Both sites had grown arable crops for many years before. 
  Although not experiments in the usual sense, these two areas of regenerating woodland are of great value, providing information on the long-term sequestration of carbon in soil and vegetation. </p>

<div align="justify"> The <b>Broadbalk</b> site grew unmanured winter wheat since 1843. Since 1882 it has been allowed to naturally revert to woodland. Large amounts of chalk had been applied, and the surface soil pH is still neutral (pH 7.7). <br clear="all" />

<div align="justify"><strong>The</strong> <strong>number of species</strong> comprising 1% or more of the biomass in response to  selected treatments. Numbers of species have decreased, even on   the nil plots. This may be due to changes in atmospheric inputs and/or changes   in sward management. Applying N as sodium nitrate (N*) or ammonium sulphate (N)   reduces diversity further, and in the ammonium form also rapidly acidifies the   soil, reducing the number of species to one or two.   Applying chalk aids recovery from acidity. Withholding N causes more species to return (not shown).

<div align="justify"><strong>The  changes in pH of the soil</strong> (at depth 0-23cm) on Park Grass in response to atmospheric deposition and fertilizer inputs, and then consequent management by liming. The pH was  approximately 5.5  when the experiment began.  A regular test of liming  began in 1903 with chalk applied every 4 years to the southern half of most  plots. Plots were then further sub-divided to give a further range of pHs. Soil pH  is c 3.5 on the plots given most ammonium  sulphate and 5.0-5.3 on the un-limed, unfertilized plots. Sub plot c of most  plots is nearest to the original soil pH. Soil pH has slowly recovered by about  0.5 pH units on some plots more than 25 years after ammonium sulphate was last  applied.
