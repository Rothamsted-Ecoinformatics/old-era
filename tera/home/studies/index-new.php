<h1>Case Studies</h1>

<p>Data held in e-RA provide a unique historic record from experiments that have measured the effects of 
agricultural practices on soils, crops and associated ecosystems continuously for over 160 years. Together
 with the retrospective analysis of archived material from the Rothamsted Sample Archive, these data
 continue to reveal new insights and important findings of relevance to today's agriculture and the wider
 environment.

This  has increased our understanding of the fate of nitrogen fertilizer, and enabled  the development of practices to reduce pollution and use scarce resources more  efficiently. Results are part of the knowledge base for DEFRA&rsquo;s Fertilizer  Recommendation System, RB209.    </td>

    <td><strong>Phosporous  fertilizer recommendations:</strong> The LTEs are essential for studying the supply of  the plant nutrient phosphorus (P) to crops. Rates of change of P reserves have  been studied in the Exhaustion Land experiment, where no P had been applied for  80 years. P was then applied at various rates to measure the rate of increase  of crop-available P. It was discovered that crop yields increase with available  soil P, up to a critical value, beyond this value, there is no further increase  in yield. This approach is the basis of P fertilizer advice in the UK and  several other countries (Poulton et al, 2013).

This work  demonstrated that P losses were low, until Olsen P reached a certain value, the <em>change point </em>after which losses  increased greatly.

Bacterial <em>abundance</em> was much lower in the bare soil than in grassland or arable soils, but the <em>diversity</em> was similar, indicating the  resilience of the soil bacterial community. <strong></strong>      <ol>

    <td width="351">Nutritional  quality of wheat grain: There is evidence from Broadbalk that  an unintended consequence of the global change to short-strawed wheat varieties  has been a decreased concentration of minerals in grain, with potential impacts  on human nutrition and health. Analysis of archived grain showed that  concentrations of Zn, Fe, Cu and Mg decreased following the change to  short-straw varieties. Concentrations of these minerals in the soil either  increased or remained constant during the duration of the experiment. (Fan et al, 2008).
