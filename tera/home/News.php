<p> <b><a  href="<?=$det?>" target="out">16-01-2019: Update to the e-RA Data Extraction Tool</a>: </b> 
 The update solves an issue we had with the values calculated after extraction of Met Data and the consistency in displaying the <b>RAD(calc)</b> value across all the weather datasets (BROOMET, ROTHMET, and WOBMET). 
 When extracting data from these datasets, the DET provides an option to calculate <a href="Met/derived_variables">derived variables</a>, one of which is <b>RAD</b>, radiation. b>RAD</b> is measured in the three weather 
 stations, but when it is missing for technical reasons, the ‘calculating tool’ derives it from SUN hours. 
The column <b>RAD</b>(calc) shows the value used in the calculations of the other derived variables (evaporation for example). It can be either RAD measured or RAD derived from SUN hours.  
The latter is now displayed in a red font to make it clear that this value is calculated from SUN hours. The value of RAD is converted to MJ/m<sup>2</sup> in the following calculations from SUN hours, 
however, the value of RAD(calc) is displayed in the same unit as the value of RAD obtained from the dataset, which can be MJ/m<sup>2</sup> for BROOMET and WOBMET, or J/m<sup>2</sup> for ROTHMET. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/Met/importantmeteorologicaldataupdates" target="out"> <b>13-08-2018 Correction to ROTHMET RAIN measurements before 2004</b></a>: Since April 2004 RAIN at Rothamsted (ROTHMET) has been measured with an ARG100 automatic tipping bucket. This has been found to capture 10% more rainfall than the manual 5 inch cyclindrical guage used previously. A double mass curve analysis of annual data from 1990-2017 gave an overall correction factor of 10%.
We recommend that when data is downloaded that spans both gauges, the 5 inch gauge data is multiplied by 1.1, to make it comparable with data from the ARG100.   This correction only applies to monthly or annual totals, and to the variable RAIN at Rothamsted. Please contact the e-RA Curators for more details.</p>

Tony Scott has reported that this may cause some interference with the measurement of wind speed and wind direction, as ideally a mast with wind sensors should be a minimum of 10 times the height of the nearest building away from the nearest building (ie at least 100m apart). This gives enough fetch for the wind to settle down.  The met station and main building have always been in these positions. Please contact the e-RA Curators for more details.</p>
