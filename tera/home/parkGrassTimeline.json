			"text": "<p>The Park Grass experiment is the oldest experiment on permanent grassland in the world. Started by Lawes and Gilbert in 1856, its original purpose was to investigate ways of improving the yield of hay by the application of inorganic fertilizers and organic manure. Within 2-3 years it became clear that these treatments were having a dramatic effect on the species composition of what had been a uniform sward. The continuing effects of the original treatments on species diversity and on soil function, together with later tests of liming and interactions with atmospheric inputs and climate change, has meant that Park Grass has become increasingly important to ecologists, environmentalists and soil scientists.</p>"

Treatments imposed in 1856 included controls (Nil - no fertilizer or manure), and various combinations of P, K, Mg, Na, with N applied as either sodium nitrate or ammonium salts. FYM (farm yard manure) was applied to two plots but was discontinued after eight years because, when applied annually to the surface in large amounts, it had adverse effects on the sward. For 19 years the re-growth was grazed by sheep penned on individual plots but since 1875 a second harvest has been cut and  removed immediately.</p><p>Park Grass probably never received the large applications of chalk that were often applied to arable fields in this part of England. The soil (0-23cm) probably had a pH (in water) of about 5.5 when the experiment began. Small amounts of chalk and lime were applied to all plots in the 1880s and 1890s <a href=\"metadata/pg/Park Grass Lime Chalk Applics1856-1902.pdf\" >Park Grass chalk/lime applications 1856-1902 (pdf).</a></p>"
